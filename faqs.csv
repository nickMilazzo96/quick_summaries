https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,What is autoimmune disease?,"Our immune system keeps us healthy by fighting off invading pathogens while simultaneously sparing our own cells and tissues. In healthy people, the immune system is able to distinguish between the self and nonself, a concept called self-tolerance. When the body is functioning properly, the immune system maintains self-tolerance while working in the background to protect the body from infections. In people with autoimmune disease, self-tolerance does not function correctly, causing the body to turn the powerful weapons of the immune system against self molecules, causing [inflammation] and injury. Autoimmune disease can be systemic, affecting multiple parts of the body, such as in diseases like *[systemic lupus erythematosus]* (SLE). They can also be organ-specific, such as in [type 1 diabetes], where the immune system targets and destroys the [insulin]-producing cells of the pancreas.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,How could diet affect autoimmune disease?,"Preclinical studies show that dietary interventions, such as elimination diets and calorie restriction in various forms (e.g., chronic caloric restriction, time-restricted feeding (TRF), and [intermittent fasting](https://examine.com/diets/16-8-intermittent-fasting/), etc.) can potentially have beneficial effects on the immune system. However, more human trials are still needed to provide a better understanding of when, and in whom, these interventions are effective. It is also important to keep in mind that the efficacy and safety of diet interventions will likely vary from person to person, with some potentially being harmful for certain people.Metabolic status in the body is intimately connected to immune function. For example, undernourished people tend to be more susceptible to infections, while the nutrient excess associated with the Western diet may be associated with increased risk of autoimmunity.[PMID:24338487] This suggests that in the future, appropriate diet interventions could potentially help to reduce disease activity in people with active disease, or even lessen disease risk in those who are susceptible.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,Which supplements are of most interest for autoimmune disease?,"Many supplements, particularly those with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity, have been investigated for their ability to reduce the severity or incidence of autoimmune disease. To date, some of the more promising evidence is for [vitamin D] and [fish oil], which were linked to reduced incidence of autoimmunity in a large randomized controlled trial.[PMID:35082139] Further research is needed to better understand the way that supplements may affect the incidence or severity of  autoimmunity in different people.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/4/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,What is a flare?,"Symptoms of many autoimmune diseases tend to increase during the active phases of the disease, and lessen or even go away during periods of remission. The term ‘flare’ refers to periods of active disease, during which symptoms can return or new symptoms develop. Flares sometimes seem to come out of nowhere, but are also often triggered by environmental factors such as injury, [stress], or infection. Anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat flares and bring about remission.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/5/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,Is it true that even healthy people can have autoantibodies?,"Yes. Healthy people have autoreactive B cells and T cells that lead to the production of  natural autoantibodies (NAA) that bind to self-antigens, but with only low to moderate affinities. In contrast to the harmful type of autoantibodies that cause the immune system to target self-tissues, NAA are beneficial and play a role in regulating[PMID:27833954] the immune system.Although NAA were first discovered[PMID:14283590] back in 1963, their exact role in the body still isn’t clear. They are thought to play a role in the first line of defense to infections and may be protective[PMID:23186367] in people with autoimmune disease.[PMID:21123325]",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/10/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/12/edit,Cancer,Who is most at risk for cancer?,"Cancer risk increases due to controllable and uncontrollable factors. Often, a specific risk factor increases risk for a specific type of cancer.Behavioral risk factors include tobacco use, excess [alcohol] consumption, poor quality dietary patterns, [obesity] (with caveats), lack of physical activity, and excessive UV radiation. Other modifiable risk factors include viral infection (i.e. [HPV]) and environmental exposures like aflatoxin and air pollution).[PMID:33538338] Some risk factors for cancer cannot be changed. Few genetic mutations cause cancer, but many genetic mutations interact with other exposures to increase or decrease cancer risk. This is called the “two-hit hypothesis”.[PMID:30562755]",

Conditions like [coronary artery disease] and [atherosclerosis] are commonly associated with cardiovascular health. However, not all cardiovascular diseases have to do with clogged and hardened blood vessels. For example, [Raynaud's disease], [varicose veins],[reference|url=https://medlineplus.gov/vasculardiseases.html|title=Medline Plus: Vascular Diseases.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/20/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/26/edit,Brain Health,Is a keto diet or supplemental ketones useful for treating cognitive decline?,"One major factor in [cognitive decline] is that the brain can fail to obtain enough energy to function properly, be it from vascular problems or [insulin resistance].[PMID:26704177][PMID:28154105][PMID:29743868] A [keto diet] is believed to provide a neuroprotective benefit by reducing oxidative stress and increasing mitochondrial respiration.[PMID:30650523]A keto diet is also believed to provide benefits by reducing the oxidation of glucose and leading to calorie restriction,[PMID:30650523] neither of which would necessarily be achieved through the use of exogenous ketone supplements. The few studies available on people with [Alzheimer’s disease](https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimersdisease.html) suggest that a ketogenic diet may provide potential benefits, but ultimately needs to overcome a brain energy deficit.[PMID:27458340] By this logic, exogenous ketones could be beneficial by allowing both [glucose] and [ketones] to act as fuel sources for the brain.Research investigating the role of [exogenous ketones] in neurodegenerative diseases and [cognitive decline] is lacking.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/22/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/26/edit,Brain Health,Is there any evidence regarding the effects of breakfast on cognition or mental tasks?,"The evidence surrounding this topic is equivocal and methodologically heterogeneous. Some studies involving healthy adults[PMID:27184286] suggest a small benefit of consuming breakfast for memory, specifically regarding particularly delayed recall, which involves reproducing information learned about 15–45 minutes prior. However, overall, no cognitive differences after skipping breakfast are observed.As with other research on breakfast consumption, these studies are acute and do not differentiate between people who habitually eat breakfast and people who do not. Thus, it’s possible that the memory effects are simply due to the fact that people who habitually eat breakfast are not physiologically adapted to skipping it. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that there is no strong evidence favoring breakfast for cognition, as it is commonly believed.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/23/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/7/edit,Diabetes & Blood Sugar,What are the basics of diabetes and blood sugar?,"Glucose is obtained by ingesting food, primarily [carbohydrates], but also [fat] and [protein]. The blood carries glucose to energy-requiring tissues throughout the body, where it is broken down into [ATP], which fuels a wide variety of bodily processes.[PMID:31424785]Diabetes is a disease characterized by blood glucose levels that are too high.[reference|url=https://medlineplus.gov/|title=The content of this page was partially adapted from MedlinePlus of the National Library of Medicine] In [type 1 diabetes], the immune system  destroys the pancreatic beta cells that produce [insulin], a hormone that tells the cells to absorb glucose and use it for energy.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/27/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/7/edit,Diabetes & Blood Sugar,Can diabetes and blood sugar change over time?,"[Blood glucose] levels increase after eating and return to baseline within a few hours. The amount by which blood glucose rises after eating is largely determined by meal composition, prior physical activity, and the time of day because glucose tolerance (i.e., how well the body resists spikes in blood glucose after eating) peaks in the morning and declines in the afternoon and evening.[PMID:29195759] Glucose tolerance also tends to decline with age.[PMID:30355075]Lifestyle changes can lead to a remission of [type 2 diabetes]. Following specific diets (e.g., low-carb, vegan, fasting) probably isn’t that important, so long as the chosen eating plan facilitates a sustained, moderate calorie deficit that results in weight loss (sometimes as little as 5%–10% of original body weight) and a reduction in intra-organ fat.[PMID:34233884][PMID:20960555][PMID:10999971] In fact, given that weight loss and maintenance is so challenging, people who are seeking to improve their type 2 diabetes with weight loss should simply focus on dietary patterns that are realistic, sustainable, and as mentally and emotionally healthy as possible. Even if weight loss isn’t attainable, physical activity alone can improve some key measures of type 2 diabetes, such as [HbA1c].[PMID:11559268] That said, these benefits are still most pronounced when there’s a simultaneous increase in physical activity and decrease in body weight.[PMID:17876019]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/28/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/7/edit,Diabetes & Blood Sugar,Who is most at risk for diabetes?,"The main cause of [type 2 diabetes] is excess fat accumulation in the liver and pancreas, which leads to [insulin resistance] and inadequate [insulin] production.[PMID:31097391] Consequently, people with [overweight] or [obesity] are at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, especially if they have an upper body and visceral fat storage pattern.[PMID:34986330][Type 1 diabetes], formerly called juvenile diabetes, is ultimately an [autoimmune disease], though it is often heritable and influenced by multiple genes,[PMID:29916386] with the highest incidences reported in Finland and other Northern European nations.[PMID:29939535] Environmental triggers, such as exposure to certain viruses (e.g., enterovirus) and nutritional factors, may also increase the risk of type 1 diabetes.[PMID:31534209] The reason why some people develop type 1 diabetes is not fully known, but the evidence is at least clear that it is caused by autoimmune destruction of the beta cells, often after a viral infection.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/29/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/7/edit,Diabetes & Blood Sugar,Why is HbA1c a marker for uncontrolled diabetes?,"When blood sugar levels are chronically elevated due to uncontrolled diabetes, red blood cells are exposed to high levels of glucose molecules. Glucose in the bloodstream will irreversibly attach itself to hemoglobin molecules at levels substantially higher than in blood without elevated blood sugar. The percentage of these “glycated” hemoglobin molecules can be measured, and the levels are used to assess how well an individual is managing their disease and whether they are at an increased risk for cardiovascular complications. [HbA1c] can be used to measure disease state. The “Hb” stands for hemoglobin, and the “A1c” is simply the type of hemoglobin that glucose attaches to. Ninety percent of hemoglobin is the “A” or “Adult” type, and “A1c” is one of the minor components of hemoglobin, which also includes A1b, A1a1, and A1a2. The key reason why HbA1c is a better marker than glucose for chronic exposure is that [blood glucose] is very transient, whereas the half life of HbA1c is about 3 months. Although HbA1c is indicative of longer-term blood sugar levels up to 3 or more months, it is likely somewhat more weighted toward blood sugar levels during the previous 2 to 4 weeks.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/30/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/7/edit,Diabetes & Blood Sugar,How can insulin resistance be measured?,"There are many ways[PMID:25593845] to measure [insulin resistance]. The gold standard is the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. In this technique, [insulin] is infused into a vein to reach a constant level in the blood. Because insulin is being pumped into the blood, the person has artificially high insulin, or hyperinsulinemia. Simultaneously, glucose is also infused at a varying rate until the blood glucose level stabilizes at a normal level. When a person’s blood glucose is normal, it is called euglycemia (the Greek root “eu-” means “good”). At this point, the rate of glucose infusion exactly equals the amount being taken up by the body’s tissues, which is a direct measure of insulin sensitivity. The more glucose that has to be infused to maintain euglycemia, the more it’s being taken up, meaning the tissue is more sensitive to insulin. The problem with this technique is that it takes a couple of hours to complete and is relatively expensive. In response, lower cost and easier to use methods of estimating insulin resistance have been developed. Two major methods are [glossary:HOMA-IR] and QUICKI. Both require only a single blood draw in order to measure fasting glucose and C-peptide, a byproduct of insulin synthesis. These values are then plugged into an equation that estimates insulin sensitivity. However, these estimations aren’t perfect.",

Different diets work differently for different people, but the best fat-loss diet for a specific person will have at least two qualities: it’ll be *hypocaloric* (it’ll make adherents eat less than they burn) and *sustainable* (it’ll fit food preferences and lifestyle well enough that adherence is possible).",

However, more recent evidence suggests that there is a plateau in total energy expenditure at high levels of physical activity,[PMID:26832439][PMID:34453886][PMID:34334719] meaning that exercising more leads to a corresponding increase in total energy expenditure up to a point. Beyond this threshold, each additional increment of exercise contributes less and less to total energy expenditure. This phenomenon, known as “energy compensation”, varies in magnitude between individuals, and seems to affect men and women of all ages similarly.[PMID:34453886]While the precise mechanisms are not entirely clear, energy compensation is a product of behavioral and physiological adaptations. Behavioral adaptations include decreases in [nonexercise activity thermogenesis] (e.g., less fidgeting, increased sitting), whereas physiological adaptations include downregulation of immune activity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system activity and reactivity, and reproductive function.[PMID:30303776]The optimal strategy for promoting weight loss is a combination of a [hypocaloric] diet and adequate amounts of exercise (i.e., enough to facilitate the rate of weight loss the individual is pursuing while maintaining muscle mass).

Whether or not bone mass is lost through resorption or gained is determined by the balance between *osteoclast* cells, which carry out bone resorption, and *osteoblast* cells, which form new bone tissue. The ability of bone to undergo dynamic remodeling is important for regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body, as well as healing bone fractures and adapting to different mechanical stimuli.[PMID: 23612223][osteoporosis], which literally means “porous bone”, is caused by an imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, favoring the bone- resorbing activity of the latter. The risk of such an imbalance greatly increases after about age 50, particularly so in women at the time of [menopause]. Osteoporosis is a common cause of bone fractures in older adults.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32112-3|title=Osteoporosis|authors=Compston et al.|journal=The Lancet|date=2019-01]",

It would follow that obesity might have a similar effect, promoting increased bone mass in response to the higher forces on the skeleton imposed by moving around at a higher body weight. Although some human studies have indicated that bone mass does increase with obesity,[PMID: 34101735] results have been mixed, with other studies finding the opposite effect: a paradoxical decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and an increase in fracture risk.[PMID:24878039] The reason for variation in associations between obesity and BMD across different studies and populations is an ongoing area of research. Animal studies have shed further light on the complex effects of obesity on bones, with one mouse study revealing an increase in bone mass during the early stages of obesity, but impaired bone formation with chronic obesity.[PMID:25576855]  In populations where it occurs, obesity-associated loss of BMD may be partially explained by the effects of obesity on *mesenchymal stem cells* (MSCs), a stem cell population in bone marrow capable of differentiating into a number of different tissues including muscle, bone (osteoblasts), fat (adipocytes), and cartilage.[PMID:23577036] Since adipocytes and bone-building osteoblast cells arise from the same MSC progenitor cells, a shift in the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes causes a reciprocal decrease in the number of osteoblasts.[PMID: 29370110] A change in the balance of osteoblasts to osteoclasts would  reduce bone mineral density over time  and increase risk of [osteoporosis].",

Cooling[PMID:26413718], especially cold water immersion, appears to be effective for mitigating DOMS, although the previously mentioned potential to blunt adaptation and delay recovery should be noted. Compression garments[PMID:23757486][PMID:26522739] mitigate decrements in muscle strength and DOMS without overtly impacting measures of muscle damage. Supplements including caffeine,[PMID:25610818] [omega-3 fats],[PMID:25610818] [tyrosine],[PMID:25610818] [whey protein],[PMID:29462923] and [BCAAs][PMID:28934166] are potential candidates and often operate through different mechanisms of action. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and magnesium have been studied for DOMS, with some positive results [PMID: 31624951].  There are a variety of herbal interventions[PMID:28265543] that could potentially ameliorate DOMS, but the reader is cautioned about the rigor of specific studies and interactions with other supplements and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, there's some evidence in favor of an anti-DOMS effect of massage.[PMID:29021762] One thing to keep in mind, though, is that both ""massage"" and ""antioxidants"" are catchall terms for groups of different interventions. Accordingly, we should be wary of unwarranted generalizations of the results of individual studies on specific antioxidants and/or massage techniques to ""antioxidants"" or ""massage therapy"" in general.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/123/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/33/edit,Pain,What are the different mechanisms that affect how diet reduces pain?,"Diet can decrease different types of pain via different mechanisms. For example, mechanical pain occurs due to disproportionate pressure on a muscle, bone, joint, or other tissue and the subsequent stimulation of mechanical nociceptors that signal pain. A diet that causes weight loss reduces the mechanical pressure of body weight on joints and bones, and this in turn can reduce pain in conditions such as [osteoarthritis] and [spinal stenosis]. Another example is inflammatory pain, which occurs when an inflammatory cascade involving the release of cytokines and mediators such as prostaglandins sensitizes the nerve fibers that produce pain signals. A diet high in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant foods might reduce the extent of an inflammatory cascade and therefore reduce pain in inflammatory conditions such as [rheumatoid-arthritis], [multiple-sclerosis], and others. Finally, visceral pain initiates in certain internal organs such as the intestines, stomach, and the heart and may be precipitated simply by distention without injury. In this example, a diet that is easily digestible and doesn’t result in intestinal distention or bloating can reduce pain in conditions such as [constipation], [dysmenorrhea], and [irritable-bowel-syndrome].[PMID:35745266][PMID:35566735]",

Genetic mutations and exposure to risk factors (e.g., cardiometabolic disorders) may slowly start to put changes into motion from birth until 40 year of age, while symptoms may not be observed until after 60 years of age. This gives a vague window from 20–60 years of age for the modification of misfolding and/or aggregation of amyloid-beta and/or tau proteins that may begin producing plaques and tangles that trigger oxidative stress and [inflammation], ultimately leading to cell death and neurodegeneration. There is likely much more nuance to this process, including the influence of diet[PMID:31022563] and lifestyle[PMID:32554763] that can prevent and/or treat these characteristic modifications of AD, but more research is needed to completely understand neurodegenerative disease.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/203/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1032/edit,Alzheimer’s Disease,What is the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease?,"The underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease is far from a settled subject, but examining shared brain characteristics of people with the disease may provide insights. One of the main features of Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques,[PMID: 20061647] which are made of a peptide called [amyloid beta](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459119/) and have been proposed as a major driver of Alzheimer’s disease. This “amyloid hypothesis” has been challenged,[PMID:24252390] however, notably because drugs targeting the amyloid pathway have not improved cognition in Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:31906949]Another primary feature of Alzheimer’s disease is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles,[PMID: 27904486] which are made up of tau proteins that, like amyloid beta, have misfolded and aggregated in the brain. According to the “tau hypothesis”, these tangles are a cause of or contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. However, because tau proteins serve important functions in the brain, another possibility is that the tangles are simply an indicator of a loss of tau function and are not harmful themselves.Also common in Alzheimer’s disease is glucose hypometabolism,[PMID:19076441] a reduction in the brain’s ability to use glucose (a type of sugar) for energy, which is why some researchers call Alzheimer’s “type 3 diabetes”.[PMID:19885299] This reduction in the brain’s energy production may contribute to the cognitive impairments seen with Alzheimer’s disease and to the development of the disease itself.[PMID:28463438]Finally, Alzheimer’s disease is neurodegenerative: it is characterized by the death of neurons (a type of brain cell) and subsequent cerebral atrophy (shrinking of the brain).[PMID:18615127] This process is believed to be central to the disease process and may be the result, at lea",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/204/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1032/edit,Alzheimer’s Disease,What are the risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease?,"**Aging**One of the most important risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease is older age. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is around 3% between ages 65 and 74, increases to 17% between 75 and 84, and reaches 32% at 85 or older.[PMID:32157811]**[Depression]**Depression has long been linked to the disease, with a 2021 meta-analysis of 28 prospective cohort studies reporting that the presence of depression or depression symptoms was associated with a 54% higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 33919227] Additionally, many genes that increase Alzheimer’s disease risk seem to do so by increasing the risk of depression.[PMID:35177243]**Being female**The overall incidence of Alzheimer’s disease is higher among females than males.[PMID: 9409336] A major reason for this could simply be that women live longer than men and, as previously noted, risk increases with age.[PMID: 30010124] Another contributing factor could be depression, which occurs more often in women[PMID:28447828] and, as covered, is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Among females, the use of estrogen replacement therapy is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s, but this has not been confirmed in clinical trials.[PMID:32210745]**Head injuries**Head injuries, such as a *[traumatic brain injury]* (TBI), may increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests people who have experienced a TBI have higher odds of developing dementia,[PMID:33044182] but the evidence is somewhat mixed as to whether TBIs increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease specifically.[PMID:34818648][PMID:28068405] It’s possible that characteristics of the injury itself could determine its effect on Alzheimer’s risk, but more research is needed. **Limited cognitive reserve**Some people seem capable of experiencing a significant amount of the neuronal death and amyloid plaque accumulation that characterize Alzheimer’s disease *without* displaying cognitive symptoms of the disease itself.[PMID:11939702][PMID:19467352] A major hypothesis used to explain these unusual cases is cognitive reserve.Cognitive reserve refers to the capacity of the brain to compensate for damage and maintain function, and is believed to vary from person to person. The greater a person’s cognitive reserve, the longer it is believed to take for the underlying brain changes to induce cognitive impairment. In line with this, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is lower in people with higher levels of education,[PMID: 32690803] a factor believed to increase cognitive reserve.Another related concept, neuroplasticity, is a broad term for the brain’s ability to alter itself. This can involve rerouting neural pathways, in some cases as a way of replacing damaged ones. An extreme example of this was described in a case study of a 29-year-old woman who had a significant stroke that required the removal of the right hemisphere of her brain.[PMID: 34992977] This initially resulted in impairments in aspects of her cognitive function, including visuospatial ability, organization, and problem solving, but when examined around 5 years later, her cognitive function appeared to be normal, likely due in part to neuroplasticity. Some factors that may promote neuroplasticity are adequate [sleep], physical activity, and environmental enrichment.[PMID:28740740]**Limited physical activity** A large number of prospective cohort studies have found that physical activity is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:28271072][PMID:28271072] In one meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, compared with little or no physical activity, high amounts of physical activity was associated with a 38% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and moderate amounts, with a 29% lower risk.**[Diabetes]**[Type 2 diabetes] has frequently been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with two meta-analyses finding an increase of about 55 to 57%.[PMID:24843720][PMID:23314404] A number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain this finding, but confirmation has remained elusive. One theory is that the brain becomes insulin resistant, and the resulting reduction in neuronal insulin signaling increases the production of amyloid beta, the main component of amyloid plaques.[PMID:25792818]Of note, the relationship between diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease does not seem to be explained by differences in body weight, as the association remains after adjusting for *[body mass index(BMI)]*.[PMID:24843720]Some evidence suggests people with [type 1 diabetes] may also be at higher risk of developing dementia.[PMID:29393220][PMID:29634288] These studies did not differentiate dementia type, however, meaning more research is needed to determine whether type 1 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease or a different form of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia).**Elevated body weight**A 2020 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found that being [overweight] or [obese] at midlife was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:32479774] One possible explanation could be that elevated body fat promotes greater [insulin resistance] and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, as discussed. Interestingly, the prior meta-analysis also found being overweight (and, in high-quality studies, obese) during later life was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s possible this merely reflects reverse confounding, as some research suggests people begin to lose weight in the years leading up to their dementia diagnosis.[PMID:28943197]**Abnormal [blood pressure]**Meta-analyses of numerous prospective cohort studies have found that hypertension ([high blood pressure]) around midlife (ages 45 to 65) is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 32450739][PMID:32690803] Hypertension was not found to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease in later life (≥65 years old), although in one meta-analysis, use of antihypertensive medication during this time was nonetheless associated with a lower risk.[PMID:32450739]Several abnormal blood pressure patterns have also been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, including [orthostatic hypotension] (low blood pressure when rising from a sitting position);[PMID:32690803] higher blood pressure in the evening, relative to the daytime;[PMID:33550821] and increased fluctuations in blood pressure (i.e., throughout the day or from day to day).[PMID:34538105]**Microbes in the brain**A growing body of evidence suggests amyloid beta may function as an antimicrobial peptide, binding to bacteria and viruses and preventing infection and disease.[PMID:29504537] The herpes virus (typically *herpes simplex virus 1*; HSV-1) is present more often in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s than those without the disease.[PMID:26401558] This has led to the theory that amyloid beta is produced as a protective response to the herpes virus in the brain and inadvertently promotes Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:30001512] Another microbe linked to Alzheimer’s disease, *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, is also associated with [periodontal disease], which itself is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:32385876] Compounds called gingipains, produced by this bacteria, have been observed at higher rates in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease and these gingipains have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in mice.[PMID:30746447] **Poor sleep quality**The glymphatic system is a sort of biological drainage system that moves fluid into and out of the brain. This fluid has been shown to collect amyloid beta and clear some of it from the brain,[PMID: 22896675] and the rate of this clearance increases dramatically during sleep.[PMID: 24136970] As a result, it’s been theorized that inadequate sleep may promote Alzheimer’s disease by disrupting the removal of amyloid beta. However, the evidence for this hypothesis is mixed.By and large, prospective cohort studies have not found an association between shorter sleep duration (about 6 hours or fewer per night) and a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but they have found a higher risk with longer sleep duration (around 9 or more hours per night).[PMID: 31604673] Most of these studies relied on self-reported sleep times, however, and several studies have found that people often inaccurately assess how much they sleep.[PMID:23622956] Meanwhile, a number of observational studies have found that poor sleep quality is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, including when using objective measures of sleep efficiency (e.g., wrist actigraph, which records movement through a device worn on the wrist).[PMID:31408876][PMID:28364458] Still, it’s important to note that neurodegenerative diseases can disrupt areas of the brain involved in sleep regulation, meaning it’s possible that poor sleep could simply be a consequence of early brain changes in the years leading up to a dementia diagnosis.",

A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found observational evidence that adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower risks of both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 34682764]**[MIND diet]**The MIND (​​Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet incorporates elements of the Mediterranean-style and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets. It favors [berries], beans, vegetables, leafy greens, whole grains, and olive oil; includes moderate fish, poultry, and wine (one glass per day); and limits sweets, [cheese], butter, [red meat], and fried foods. The MIND diet has been the subject of less research than the Mediterranean diet, but at least one cohort study found that higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:25681666]**[Ketogenic diet]**A ketogenic diet shows some evidence of benefit for people with Alzheimer’s disease, which is covered in more detail in a later section. There is currently no evidence that a ketogenic diet can prevent Alzheimer’s disease.",

A 2014 meta-analysis of six prospective cohort studies found that a 100-gram increase in weekly fish intake was associated with an 11% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:25446949] A 2018 meta-analysis of five prospective cohort studies likewise found an association between higher fish intake and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease among people with a genetic predisposition to the disease.[PMID:29053784]Although a possible candidate for this protective association are the omega-3 fatty acids found in seafood, this does not appear to be the case. In the 2014 meta-analysis, a higher intake of *long-chain omega-3s* was not associated with a lower Alzheimer’s disease. **[Coffee]**A 2018 meta-analysis of five prospective cohort studies found no association between coffee consumption of up to 5 cups per day and risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:30322179] However, at least one study found that drinking more than six cups of coffee per day was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:34424144] It’s worth noting that disturbed sleep appears to increase brain levels of amyloid beta,[PMID:31408876] and a 2017 meta-analysis found that having sleep problems was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:28364458] Given that caffeine is one factor that can [negatively impact sleep](https://examine.com/nutrition/ten-tips-for-better-sleep/), being mindful of caffeine intake (from coffee and other sources) may be important in reducing Alzheimer’s risk.**[Alcohol]**Observational evidence has frequently found that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease compared with no alcohol consumption.[PMID:19546653][PMID:26294005] One concern raised with this data, however, is that these findings could be the result of confounding factors (e.g., people who drink in moderation may be more likely to have other healthy habits).[PMID: 31400826] This would also explain why genetic evidence largely hasn’t found a beneficial link between alcohol and Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:31786126][PMID:26294005]Meanwhile, one study, utilizing data from seven cohort studies, found that a history of drinking to the point of losing consciousness (i.e., passing out) was associated with roughly double the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 32902651]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/207/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1032/edit,Alzheimer’s Disease,Is there any evidence for the use of supplements in Alzheimer’s disease?,"**B vitamins**High levels of the amino acid [homocysteine] have been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 34101791] Because [folic-acid], [vitamin-b6], and [vitamin-b12] play a central role in the metabolism of homocysteine, these vitamins have been extensively tested in clinical trials for their ability to improve cognitive function after the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, with the evidence as a whole indicating little-to-no benefit.**Vitamin D**A large body of evidence suggests the immune system facilitates Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID: 28941639] Given this, vitamin D, which can influence immune function, may have an effect on the disease. One clinical trial supports a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Mendelian randomization trials have also found that having genetically higher vitamin D levels seems to lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:31815694][PMID:30200567]**Vitamin E**Oxidative stress, including oxidative damage to neuronal proteins and DNA, seems to occur during the development of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:11487050][PMID:19372765] If this process contributes to the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, a viable intervention could be supplementing with vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. A few clinical trials have tested the effect of a very high dose of vitamin E on people with Alzheimer’s disease, with some mixed evidence of benefit, but vitamin E supplementation does not seem to prevent dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in at-risk people.**[Omega-3 fatty acids]**The human brain contains a large quantity of the LCn3 *docosahexaenoic acid* (DHA),[PMID:25954194] making it a reasonable hypothesis that supplementing with DHA and its precursor, *eicosapentaenoic acid* (EPA), could benefit brain health. Additionally, experiments on rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease have provided support for a beneficial effect of LCn3s.[PMID:31132459][PMID:15788759] Despite this, clinical trials looking at the effect of LCn3s among people with Alzheimer’s disease suggest no benefit. More research is needed to determine whether supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can help *prevent* Alzheimer’s disease. **[Alpha-GPC]**Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in cognitive function, and reductions in its signaling contribute to some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. As a result, people with the disease are frequently prescribed medications called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), which inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing its levels in synapses. AChEIs can modestly benefit symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease but do not slow progression of the disease itself.[PMID:14754384] L-Alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine, or alpha-GPC, is a choline-containing compound that is believed to better deliver choline to the brain, where it can be used for acetylcholine synthesis (acetylcholine is made from choline and a molecule called acetyl-CoA). Preliminary evidence from a few clinical trials suggests alpha-GPC is beneficial for people with Alzheimer’s disease.**[Ginkgo biloba]**Ginkgo biloba tree leaves, commonly known simply as ginkgo biloba, are often used as a dietary supplement and contain a variety of terpenoids (a type of plant metabolite) known as ginkgolides. Ginkgo biloba may increase cerebral blood flow,[PMID:21061003] which could benefit brain health, and ginkgolides have shown some benefit in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:20162004] Although several clinical trials indicate ginkgo biloba may be beneficial for Alzheimer’s, the data as a whole are somewhat inconsistent (with seemingly variable responses based on the test used) and often have serious shortcomings (e.g., poor distinction between Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia types). Ginkgo biloba does not seem to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.**[Lion’s mane] mushroom**It has been posited that *Hericium erinaceus*, commonly known as lion’s mane mushroom, benefits cognitive function, partly based on research suggesting it increases levels of *nerve growth factor* (NGF), a peptide important to the growth and survival of neurons. However, whether lion’s mane (or, more specifically, terpenoids called erinacines, found in lion’s mane) actually stimulates NGF remains a source of debate. Highly preliminary research from a few clinical trials indicates lion’s mane may be beneficial for people with or at risk of Alzheimer’s disease.**[Panax ginseng]**Panax ginseng (aka Asian ginseng, Chinese ginseng, Korean ginseng, or even just ginseng) is a plant whose roots are often used as a supplement. One component of panax ginseng, called gintonin, has been studied in animal models for its potential to inhibit amyloid beta toxicity[PMID:26255830][PMID:27765516], making it a possible candidate for improving — or at least slowing — cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease. Preliminary evidence from a few clinical trials suggests panax ginseng is beneficial for people with the disease.**[Saffron]**Saffron contains potentially bioactive compounds, including crocin, crocetin, and safranal, that experiments performed in rodent models suggest may be able to reduce the accumulation and toxicity of amyloid beta.[PMID:30450117][PMID:26484504][PMID:28471166][PMID:29357117] Preliminary evidence from a few clinical trials suggests saffron is beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease.**[Sodium oligomannate]**Sodium oligomannate is a supplement (sold as GV-971) made from oligosaccharides (sugars) in a species of kelp called *Ecklonia kurome*. Some research suggests sodium oligomannate may reduce amyloid beta deposits in the brain (possibly via effects on the microbiome),[PMID: 31488882] and one trial by a company that sells a sodium oligomannate supplement found that it benefited cognition in people with Alzheimer’s disease.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/208/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1032/edit,Alzheimer’s Disease,What effect do ketones have on Alzheimer’s disease?,"Alzheimer’s disease commonly features a reduced ability to generate energy from glucose, and this deficit may largely affect cognitive function. So how might this be remedied? Enter [ketones]. Some evidence suggests that although glucose metabolism may be impaired, the brain’s ability to utilize ketone bodies for energy is relatively unaffected, at least in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:25147107] Given this, a [ketogenic diet] or ketogenic supplements may improve neuronal energy production and produce clinical benefits.One RCT looked at the effect of a ketogenic supplement called AC-1202 (which consists mostly of caprylic acid) on cognitive function among 152 people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:19664276] For 90 days participants took either AC-1202 or a placebo, with cognitive function assessed using two tests: the ADAS-Cog and MMSE. ADAS-Cog scores had improved at day 45, but not at day 90, and there was no difference in MMSE scores between groups at any point. Interestingly, a subgroup analysis found that ADAS-Cog scores were improved at days 45 and 90 in non-carriers of APOE4 but not improved at either time point in carriers of the gene.A crossover RCT published in 2021 examined the effect of a ketogenic diet on 26 people with Alzheimer’s disease.[PMID:33622392] Participants were assigned to follow either a ketogenic diet (with a target of 6% of calories from carbohydrates) or low-fat diet for 12 weeks, later switching to the other diet after a 10-week washout period. Compared with the low-fat diet, the ketogenic diet improved both the ability to perform daily activities and quality of life. The ketogenic diet did not improve cognitive function in the overall analysis, but an improvement was seen when compliance was factored in (including only assessing participants who achieved a beta-hydroxybutyrate (a ketone body) level of at least 0.6 millimoles per liter).",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/249/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1036/edit,Atherosclerosis,What causes atherosclerosis?,"Atherosclerosis starts with damage to the interior lining of medium and large arteries, which often occurs in arteries that are under high pressure and tension, a process that can start in childhood.[PMID:3455748] This damage leads to the fats — which are mostly in the form of [low density lipoprotein (LDL)](https://examine.com/topics/ldl/), but can also be carried by other apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins[PMID:32052833] — being trapped in the interior arterial lining. The more such lipoproteins there are, the more that can get trapped. The fats then get oxidized, which attracts white blood cells — mainly macrophages — to try to clean up the mess. However, when there’s a lot of fat to clean up, the macrophages overdo it and transform into foam cells, which is one of the main ingredients of atherosclerotic plaque formation.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/250/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1036/edit,Atherosclerosis,Does cholesterol really cause atherosclerosis?,"Put simply: pretty much, yes. If you go to the doctor, and get your “bad cholesterol” (LDL-C) measured, that will predict heart disease risk very well. But the details are a bit more complicated, so let’s go over them. Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are one of several types of particles that transport fats in the blood. Fats need to be packaged like this since they’re hydrophobic (i.e., they’ll separate out in water), and the blood is mostly water.The liver releases fats to the bloodstream by packaging them in very-low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) that contain both triglycerides and cholesterol. These VLDLs provide the body with fats, and in the process of delivering those fats, are transformed into LDL.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-04328-1.50013-9|title=Cardiovascular Pathology|published=2007 pp. 169-195|authors=King TC|journal=Elsevier's Integrated Pathology]LDL particles are very widely accepted as being a main cause of atherosclerosis.[PMID:28444290][PMID:25815993] But clinics don’t usually measure LDL particles. Insead, they usually measure the amount of cholesterol contained in LDL particles: LDL-C. Because LDL is very cholesterol-rich, this serves as an excellent proxy for LDL levels in the blood, and thus correlates very well to atherosclerotic risk.But the blood level of LDL-C alone does not tell the whole story of atherosclerosis.[PMID:33883728] First, any cholesterol particle with a specific protein called *ApoB*, including LP(a), remnant particles, and very low density, low density, and intermediate density lipoproteins, can play a role in depositing fats like cholesterol and [triglycerides] into vessel walls, inducing inflammation, and making atherosclerosis worse.[PMID:28299190] That’s because oxidized particles with ApoB are recognized and taken up by immune cells, which starts building up the fatty streak mentioned above.[PMID:21084697]Second, preliminary evidence suggests that LDL particles with different densities have differing atherosclerotic potential: small dense LDL particle levels better predict heart disease risk and may be able to cause more damage than large buoyant LDL particles.[PMID:32281547][PMID:28299190] Next, the inflammatory environment in which LDL-C particles are circulating affects the extent and type of immune activation and fatty acid oxidation, which is necessary for atherosclerotic progression.[PMID:16778830] Lastly, other components deposited in plaques — oxidized fats, [triglycerides], calcium, dead cells, and scar tissue — affect plaque stability and resistance to further damage.[PMID:16778830] Taken together, LDL particles which are rich in cholesterol play a major role in causing atherosclerosis, but the presence of other factors may determine the extent of that damage.",

Evidence from animal and human studies using drugs has made it clear that atherosclerosis can actually be reversed to some degree.[PMID:31986087] There’s also some evidence from studies that image blood vessels have shown that atherosclerosis can be reversed by diet and lifestyle interventions to some extent as well, although the evidence is more confounded since most of the evidence looks at combined, complex lifestyle interventions.[PMID:29807666] For example, a holistic lifestyle and plant-based diet intervention showed reversal of blocked arteries.[PMID:23550427] Also, an [olive oil]-rich [Mediterranean diet] was able to reduce the thickness of artery plaque among people with coronary artery disease.[PMID:34372670] Weight loss is well-established to prevent atherosclerosis,[PMID:30879355] but weight loss has lackluster effects on reversing established atherosclerosis in people with [type 2 diabetes].[PMID:23796131] Overall, it looks like adopting a healthy dietary pattern may either slow or possibly reverse the narrowing of arteries due to atherosclerosis, particularly in early stages of plaque formation[PMID:34987194], and these effects are enhanced alongside lifestyle changes like exercising, stress management, and quitting smoking.",

Because both criteria are similar, this section will focus only on the DSM-5 criteria. Keep in mind that, no matter which criteria are used, the clinical manifestation of ASD will vary across individuals.According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of ASD requires the presence of persistent difficulty with social communication and interaction in all three of the following categories: social-emotional reciprocity (e.g., failing to engage in mutually agreeable back-and-forth conversation, difficulty initiating or responding to social interactions); nonverbal communication behaviors (e.g., poor eye contact, lack of facial expressions, misunderstanding use of gestures); and developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g., difficulty adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts).

It has been hypothesized that the paternal X chromosome may play a role in protecting women and girls from developing ASD [PMID:23431162]. During fetal development, one X chromosome in female babies’ cells expresses its 1,100 genes while the other is inactivated. The inactivation of this X chromosome makes it less likely for mutated genes to be expressed in developing female cells.[PMID:10625077][PMID:17707844]Some researchers propose that women and girls who were exposed to excess androgens in utero are at greater risk of developing autistic traits,[PMID:16624315][PMID:20877284] but this is controversial.[PMID:26307613]It’s also possible that the current assessment tools for ASD are less effective at capturing features of ASD that are unique to women and girls (a phenomenon known as “diagnostic bias”).[PMID:21695109] For example, women and girls with ASD are more likely to camouflage or mask[PMID:27899710] their behaviors, meaning that they may adopt a socially acceptable persona by copying facial expressions and purposefully making eye contact.

Symptoms of Fragile X syndrome include ear, nose, and throat problems (ear infections or sinusitis), developmental delays, motor dysfunction, and the physical appearance of a long face with prominent forehead and protrusile ears.[PMID:29083768] These symptoms typically do not display until early childhood. Roughly 50% of individuals with Fragile X meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD and tend to have more severe developmental and behavioral problems.[PMID:28814540] Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs predominantly in girls. The first signs of Rett syndrome are a failure to meet development milestones, usually between 6 and 18 months of age. Active regression occurs between 1 and 4 years of age, in which there is a loss of motor function and language skills. Eventually, this loss plateaus, although some individuals experience improvements in ASD traits through early adulthood.

Such exposures may modulate the expression of the genetic factors that place an individual at higher risk for ASD.

Simply put, the GFR rate is a measure of kidney function and describes the flow rate (milliliters per minute, or mL/min) of filtered fluid through the kidney. The normal range of GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is 100–130 mL/min/1.73 m^2^. The GFR is adjusted for body surface area since bigger kidneys can filter more fluid, and kidneys get bigger as body surface area gets bigger.In practice, there are two types of GFR rates[PMID:24840668], depending on how the parameter is determined. The measured GFR (mGFR) is obtained by infusing an external substance that has some good properties for measuring how much fluid the kidney filters. Ideally, the substance would be only eliminated through the kidney, is filtered easily, and is not reabsorbed when it passes through the kidney. One commonly-used substance that checks all the boxes for an mGFR marker is inulin.The mGFR is the most accurate method to assess renal function. However, it’s also an impractical and expensive method, as the person undergoing the procedure needs to remain in the clinic for several hours. A more convenient and affordable way is to determine the *estimated* GFR (eGFR). The eGFR is, as the name implies, estimated based on the clearance of a marker that the body makes itself, so nothing needs to be infused. Two common markers are serum creatinine and cystatin C, which can be readily determined from blood samples and fed into equations that give an eGFR value. Due to its simplicity and practicality, the [eGFR is also more unreliable, as it often lacks both precision and accuracy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836491/).The 2012 [KDIGO guidelines](https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO*2012*CKD*GL.pdf) for chronic kidney disease split the difference between convenience and accuracy. They’re fine with using a specific equation to calculate eGFR from serum creatinine levels, but they recommend following up with an eGRF using cystatin C or mGFR to diagnose CKD. They also recommend mGFR when an important clinical decision hinges on an accurate reading.",

Contrary to the international guidelines, the use of low protein diets as a dietary intervention in CKD management varies between countries and even within countries.

Topical barrier creams, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are often used initially, but for many these are not sufficient, and additional methods of itch-control are often used before resorting to immunosuppressive drugs. The first step to managing itch is prevention, with the most common being a daily bathing and moisturizing routine using eczema medications. Unfortunately, scratching the affected skin can sometimes make eczema worse — leading to more rashes, thickened skin, and infections.There are several at-home remedies for itchy skin including:- Low-pH skin cleansers- Cold compress- Pinching and patting the itchy skin instead of scratching- [Acv], [baking soda], or oatmeal soap bath- Wet wrap therapy- Frequently moisturizing the affected area[reference|url=https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/itchy-skin/|title=Managing Itch|authors=National Eczema Association|date=Accessed June 28, 2022] We can not currently vouch for the efficacy of these methods, but they are commonly used.",

Another genetic cause is gene variants of the serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type 5 (SPINK5) gene, which codes for a protein that helps regulate desquamation (peeling/shedding of the outermost layer of skin, which is a normal part of cell turnover but can go awry), preventing excessive breakdown of the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of skin). It also has implications for the skin barrier and skin dryness.[PMID:32664181]Besides FLG and SPINK5, some other genes related to atopic dermatitis are also related to immune function and inflammation, namely the cytokines IL-4 and IL-10.[PMID:28169853][PMID:30932690]  Gene variants in TLR2 and TLR4, which are involved in the activation of inflammatory signaling, are also associated with a higher risk.[PMID:30273064]> Atopic dermatitis is a multifaceted disease with many processes that work together; variations in genes related to skin cell turnover, skin barrier maintenance, and inflammation are all likely to contribute.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/385/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1047/edit,Eczema,How does the gut microbiome influence eczema?,"The gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of immune function, with symbiotic bacteria helping to curtail immune activation that can aggravate atopic dermatitis. There is evidence that the gut microbiome is less diverse and there are fewer of some beneficial species in people with atopic dermatitis.[PMID:34335634] Interestingly, dysbiosis in infants is associated with atopic dermatitis later in life.It’s possible that, instead of alterations in the skin microbiome causing atopic dermatitis, the skin condition leads to microbial changes. Consequently, these changes in the skin microbiome can be seen as more of an exacerbating factor in atopic dermatitis rather than an initial cause, though a causal role is possible in some instances.[PMID:31444782][PMID:31677162] In atopic dermatitis, the lesions are extremely likely to have an overabundance of the bacterium *Staphylococcus. aureus*, which can worsen inflammation and lead to dysregulated desquamation and insufficient beneficial species. Fungi of the *Malassezia* genus, as well as some others, may also aggravate atopic dermatitis in some scenarios. There is also the phenomenon of the herpes simplex virus migrating to atopic dermatitis lesions and causing complications, called eczema herpeticum.[PMID:31677162]> Lower microbial diversity and low populations of beneficial species in the gut are associated with the risk for atopic dermatitis. When it comes to the skin microbiome, an imbalance is likely more of a consequence of atopic dermatitis than an initial cause, though a partial role can’t be ruled out in some cases.",

It should be noted that these observations are based on a relatively small amount of research. It is possible that alcohol exposure in utero can lead to an immune system imbalance — called Th2 dominance — that is more associated with atopic dermatitis, but there may be other reasons.There is some evidence that being born in winter or fall is associated with a greater prevalence of atopic dermatitis.[PMID:31678290] One probable reason for this is lower humidity and an increased risk of skin dryness and disrupted skin barrier function during the first months of life. Higher immune activity during winter has also been observed, which could increase the likelihood of excessive skin inflammation. [Vitamin D] levels are a plausible cause, but the evidence for this scenario specifically isn’t compelling.[PMID:26813208][PMID:26239464]A meta-analysis found that a mother taking [probiotic] mixtures during pregnancy or breastfeeding can reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis in her children.[PMID:31721162] This provides evidence that the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy is relevant to offspring, though evidence outside of the context of probiotic supplementation is lacking. Another meta-analysis, investigating the effects of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* bacteria mixtures in children, also found convincing evidence for a reduction in risk.[PMID:33923096] However, it should be noted that almost all studies included supplementation during pregnancy; only two studies didn’t.

A total of 5 studies looked only at supplementation for infants; the results were positive overall, but we can’t be sure of them, and more research is needed.[PMID:34006167] The evidence for giving infants and children probiotics for prevention is promising but very preliminary.Early-life antibiotic use is associated with a higher risk of atopic dermatitis, though this could be as a result of an increased risk of infections due to other factors that further increase the risk of the skin condition.[PMID:23782060]Being [overweight] or gaining a large amount of weight during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of atopic dermatitis in children, while low weight gain during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk.[PMID:33621384] These risks are small, and the extent to which the weight gain itself — rather than confounding factors, such as [stress] — plays a role is unclear.Preliminary evidence suggests that maternal stress, [anxiety], and adverse life events that could be causes of stress and anxiety are associated with a greater risk of atopic dermatitis in their children.[PMID:29495329]There is also some evidence that prenatal phthalate exposure increases the risk. [PMID:34187630]> The gut microbiome seems to be critical early in life to the risk for atopic dermatitis.

However, the studies in general had a notable risk for bias, so more research will be needed to both confirm efficacy and clarify which combinations of probiotics are best. The meta-analysis only included studies where a dermatologist had evaluated the participants with the SCORAD method, which lends itself to a higher level of objective measurements but limited the number of studies. Another meta-analysis that included any trial that used probiotics to treat pediatric eczema found a general benefit, but again, multiple studies on particular strains or mixtures are needed before we can know how to optimally use probiotics. Finally, a meta-analysis looked at synbiotic (a combination of pre- and probiotics) supplements, and out of 6, a statistically significant benefit was found, but it’s unclear if synbiotics are superior to probiotics or which synbiotics are best.[PMID:26810481]> Pharmaceutical and supplement therapies for atopic dermatitis are largely centered around substances that modify immune response to reduce the effects of persistent inflammation.",

While elevated intraocular pressure is an important risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma, not all people with elevated intraocular pressure will develop glaucoma. Moreover, many people will develop glaucoma even in the absence of elevated intraocular pressure in what is termed “normal-tension glaucoma”.[PMID:29456252] The implication from the above is that the amount of tolerated intraocular pressure may vary between individuals,[PMID:25711633] and that the pathophysiology of glaucoma is likely multifactorial; that is, factors other than intraocular pressure are involved in the development and progression of the condition.",

These include *nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs* (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids.Several medications can also be taken regularly to reduce [uric acid] levels, preventing future gout attacks. These medications act by reducing uric acid production (e.g., allopurinol) or increasing uric acid excretion (e.g., probenecid). Uric-acid lowering drugs can increase the risk of gout attacks initially, so they are often given with a medication called colchicine for the first 3–6 months to mitigate this risk.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/459/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1053/edit,Gout,How does high uric acid cause gout?,"The most important known cause of gout is elevated levels of [uric acid] in the blood, as the propensity of MSU crystals to develop in joints increases as uric acid levels rise.[PMID:24703341] Although there is no precise level at which uric acid crystals form, a blood uric acid level above 6.8 mg/dL, clinically referred to as hyperuricemia, is often cited as the level at which gout risk rises dramatically. This is approximately the solubility of MSU in normal saline at 37℃. In the Framingham Heart Study,[PMID:20131266] the annual occurrence of gout was linearly associated with uric acid levels. In the study, after adjusting for potential confounders, high uric acid (7 to 7.9 mg/dL) was associated with 12 times the risk of gout in women and a 22 times the risk of gout among men compared to having low uric acid (<5 mg/dL), with risks continuing to rise as uric acid levels increased.Figure 2: The association between uric acid levels and gout incidence[img|https://examine.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/supplements/gout/rpnYAkjSFzMeyTfzSJUZIbOR0VmamAbc2OxBRPKM.png|title=Uric acid levels and gout risk][CENTER]<small>Adapted from PMID: 20131266</small>[/CENTER]Uric acid levels are determined by two processes: uric acid excretion and uric acid production. The primary route of uric acid removal from the body is via urinary excretion. Uric acid in the blood is filtered into the kidneys, where most is reabsorbed back into the blood, with a smaller amount passed into urine. Reductions in uric acid excretion by the kidneys appears to be most responsible for hyperuricemia.[PMID:12522834][PMID:16820043] A lesser pathway of uric acid removal (roughly 1/3 of uric acid excretion) is via the intestinal system. Uric acid production, meanwhile, is the result of the metabolism of compounds called purines. These purines are derived both endogenously (in the body) from the breakdown of tissues and energy substrates as well as exogenously (outside the body) from eating foods containing purines and purine precursors. While elevated uric acid is the primary cause of gout, many people with hyperuricemia do not develop gout, suggesting other factors play a role in the development of gout.[PMID:33672821] In particular, the development of MSU crystals likely varies depending on a number of factors, including the temperature and pH of the gout-affected tissues.[PMID: 26467213] The body's inflammatory reaction to uric acid crystals is also an important determinant of the occurrence and severity of gout.",

Specifically, reductions in kidney function might increase uric acid levels, or increased uric acid might cause reduced kidney function, or possibly a mix of both.[PMID:23543594]**[Hypertension]**: Hypertension is associated with higher uric acid levels, possibly as a result of effects of high blood pressure on kidney function.

Exactly how much purine restriction can lower uric acid levels may depend on baseline purine intake and degree of restriction and unfortunately there is limited well-conducted research on the topic. One study on people with hyperuricemia reported a 0.57 mg/dL drop in uric acid after 2 weeks on a low purine diet, however this study lacked a control group.[PMID: 15868628] To make matters more complicated, there are several types of purines and some evidence indicates they are not all equal in their effects on uric acid levels.[PMID: 1784734] Because the amount of each purine type varies between foods, this means two foods might differ in their effect on uric acid even when purine levels are the same. One study, for example, found that the increase in uric acid 2-hours after eating a meal with either [haddock] (+0.34 mg/dL) or soybeans (+0.32 mg/dL) was greater than after a meal with beef liver (+0.15 mg/dL), despite a similar purine content between the three meals.[PMID:1619189][img|https://examine.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/supplements/gout/cA8M28YoudRjREY4JCsE2KGXbt3n5rizvSBXBxIx.png|title=Average purine content of food groups]<div class=""text-center""><small>Adapted from Wu et al.

Though sampling this way can accurately detect intestinal overgrowth of bacteria and fungi, these studies found that the rates of unexplained GI symptoms were similar in participants regardless of their fungal colonization. [In a study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085(14)61294-4) that sampled the gastric (stomach) mucosa of people with dyspepsia (indigestion) or ulcer complaints,  *Candida* was present in approximately 27% of the participants (with no control samples for comparison). A follow-up study compared participants with and without SIFO, and found no differences in the severity of the participants’ GI symptoms. In that study, 25% of the participants with unexplained digestive complaints also had SIFO.Though prescription antacid medications and altered gut motility (organized muscular contractions) may increase the risk of developing SIBO, they aren’t associated with SIFO.[PMID: 23574267]",

Patients with IBD often use certain medications that increase the risk for fungal disease, which could also explain these findings.[PMID: 29453860]  *Candida* abundance is also associated with visceral hypersensitivity (a heightened sense of pain in response to normal gut functions) in a subgroup of IBS that responds well to antifungal treatment.[PMID: 33420127] Exploratory studies have noted that higher *Candida* abundance is associated with more severe [bloating].[PMID: 33839797] Though *Candida* species are present in people with and without IBS, other emerging evidence suggests that *C. albicans* in people with IBS is genetically distinct from the same species in healthy people.

However, in each of these studies, body weight either did not change (the studies on monounsaturated fat) or increased (the studies on polyunsaturated fat).A randomized controlled trial in participants with abdominal obesity found that a hypocaloric diet enriched in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (13.4% and 7.7% of energy intake) and reduced in saturated fat (8.3% of energy intake) produced similar reductions in liver fat as a hypocaloric diet that was lower in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (9.3% and 4.1% of energy intake) and higher in saturated fat (14.9% of energy intake).[PMID:35102369] Although it’s possible that the difference in unsaturated fat intake wasn’t large enough to produce significant differences in liver fat between groups, these findings suggest that the potent effects of energy restriction on liver fat far outweigh the effects of the type of fat consumed.",

Osteoblasts are tasked with adding bone mass, while osteoclasts actively digest it and cause bone resorption. In the context of diseases like osteoporosis, increasing osteoclast number or activity shifts the balance toward bone resorption, causing a progressive loss of bone density over time.[PMID:29386866] Bone is capable of sensing mechanical stress, which lessens in response to weight loss. This shifts the balance of bone remodeling cells.Calorie restriction also alters a number of hormones that play a role in the regulation of bone mass. Reductions in body fat have been linked to reduced levels of [estrogen] and other sex hormones,[PMID:571447] and increased [sex hormone binding globulin] (SHBG), a protein that binds to and sequesters hormones, blocking their function.Although shifts in overall hormone levels during calorie restriction and weight loss can be subtle, small changes in hormone levels (particularly [estrogens], and [IGF-1])[PMID:3388021][PMID:11891862][PMID:7537760] can work through both direct and indirect mechanisms to alter the balance of osteoblast vs. osteoclasts activity to promote bone resorption and decreased bone density.",

Two reasons have been suggested to explain this phenomenon:- Your body draws from its calcium stores (in bones) to buffer the acid load caused by dietary protein. This has led researchers to suggest that higher protein intake could increase bone loss.[PMID:9614169]- Most studies that looked at protein intake and calcium excretion list [dairy] products as a protein source,[PMID:24852037] so higher urinary calcium could simply be the result of higher [calcium] intake (i.e., more calcium in, more calcium out).Therefore, looking only at calcium *excretion *wasn’t enough. Subsequent studies showed that dietary protein promotes dietary-[calcium] absorption[PMID:19279077] and that high protein intake “promotes bone growth and retards bone loss whereas low-protein diet is associated with higher risk of hip fractures.”[PMID:28404575] High-protein diets have also been shown to modestly suppress the decrease in [bone mineral density](https://examine.com/topics/bone-mineral-density/) caused by weight loss.[PMID:31301138]What happens is that when you ingest more protein, you absorb more of the calcium in your food, so less calcium ends up in your feces. Later, your body gets rid of the calcium it doesn’t need, so more calcium ends up in your urine, but not as much as would have otherwise ended in your feces.[PMID:22127335] Therefore, an increase in protein intake leads to an overall decrease in calcium excretion, which points to an increase in calcium retention. High-protein diets also raise your *insulin-like growth factor-1* ([IGF-1]),[PMID:23721057] which notably promotes bone growth.[PMID:12235108]All in all, current evidence suggests that *protein’s effect on bones is either neutral or beneficial*.[PMID:22127335][PMID:19419322]",

Some of the environmental risk factors include a history of smoking, exposure to silica (via dust or occupational exposure) or infectious agents, vitamin D deficiency, and obesity. There is also a significant genetic component to RA. Studies in twins have estimated that RA may have around 60% heritability.[PMID:10643697] Certain variants of the *human leukocyte antigen* (HLA) genes, which encode proteins that are important for the function of the immune system, have strong risk associations with RA.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/781/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1079/edit,Rheumatoid Arthritis,What does 60% “heritability” mean?,"Technically speaking, heritability estimates the amount of phenotypic variation (i.e., the variation in a certain trait, such as having RA) that is caused by variation in genes in a given population. An easier way to understand the concept is to consider the extremes. A heritability of 100% would indicate that RA (or the trait in question) could be 100% attributed to genetics and 0% to environmental factors. In contrast, a heritability of 0% would indicate that genetics were not involved whatsoever in developing the disease. It is important to note that “60% heritability” does not mean that, in any individual with RA, 60% of the cause can be chalked up to genetics. (Heritability is defined only at the population level, not at the individual level.) It also does not mean that 60% of individuals with RA have RA because of their genetic makeup.",

Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability due to cumulative decline in multiple physiological systems[PMID:23395245] and involves adverse effects to physical, cognitive, and social dimensions.[PMID:22717010] Sarcopenia contributes to the physical aspect of frailty, but it differs from frailty because it only affects the musculoskeletal system, whereas frailty is a much broader condition.Both malnutrition and sarcopenia are characterized by low muscle mass, but sarcopenia also includes impaired muscle function. Additionally, reduced fat mass is typically present in malnutrition, but not sarcopenia.[PMID:30312372][Cachexia] is described as severe weight loss and muscle wasting associated with conditions such as [cancer], [HIV]/AIDS, or end-stage organ failure. Cachexia and sarcopenia may coexist, but the presence of the aforementioned conditions suggests that cachexia is more likely.[PMID: 32809648] Unlike sarcopenia, cachexia is characterized by systemic inflammation, as indicated by low [serum albumin](https://examine.com/topics/serum-albumin/) and elevated [C-reactive protein] levels.[PMID:24321611] The diagnosis of cachexia also typically requires unintentional weight loss of at least 5% of body weight in the past six months.[PMID:24321611]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/795/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1080/edit,Sarcopenia,Does protein source matter?,"Animal-based proteins are generally higher quality than plant-based proteins because they contain adequate amounts of all the [essential amino acid]s (EAA) and are better digested and absorbed.[PMID: 35108354] Consequently, studies typically report a greater increase in [muscle protein synthesis] (MPS) following the ingestion of animal-based proteins.[PMID:34515966]To overcome the lesser anabolic properties of plant-based proteins, a greater amount of protein can be consumed.[PMID:27440260][PMID:22698458] In a 3-day study in older adults (average age of 66), daily MPS rates did not differ between a high-protein (1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day) [vegan diet] that provided 57% of protein as mycoprotein and a high-protein omnivorous diet.[PMID:33172506]An alternative (or even additional) strategy is to combine different plant-based proteins to provide a balanced EAA profile,[PMID:33133540] as plant-based proteins typically contain an inadequate amount of one or more EAA.While studies looking at acute changes in MPS are informative, they do not directly reflect longer-term changes in muscle mass and strength, which is what we’re really concerned with. Evidence suggests plant- and animal-based protein supplements have a similar effect on changes in muscle mass and strength in older adults (≥ 50 years).[PMID:33670701] However, consuming an omnivorous diet and obtaining 25–50 grams of protein per day from a plant-based protein supplement is very different from consuming a vegan diet.

Bloating, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are some of the most common symptoms, but constipation may also occur in certain types of SIBO.[PMID:33720574][PMID:34190027] Some theories suggest that SIBO may affect gut motility and induce constipation by [altering the serotonin pathway](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/10/2065) that coordinates intestinal contractions or producing excess methane, which slows intestinal transit (the speed at which food moves through the intestines).[PMID:34190027]Anemia isn’t a primary symptom, but it has been identified as a [predictor of SIBO](http://www.jocmr.org/index.php/JOCMR/article/view/4320).

Breath tests are an indirect way to measure bacteria in the small intestine, but their ease and low invasiveness make them a more common diagnostic tool than the fluid test.[PMID:28323273][PMID:31743632]During a breath test, the patient ingests a carbohydrate — usually glucose or lactulose — which is fermented by bacteria in the small intestine. The bacteria produce hydrogen and methane, which are expelled and measured in the patient’s exhaled breath. (Hydrogen sulfide is also produced, but only in recent years has it been added to some tests.) The quantity and production rate of these gasses can then be used to estimate the number of microbes in the small intestine,  because gut microbes are the only source of hydrogen and methane.

This test requires intubating the patient, which involves inserting a tube into their throat and routing it through their stomach to reach the first section of their small intestine, where the clinician will aspirate (suction out) multiple samples of liquid. Swabs of the liquid are applied to cell culture plates that support the growth of many (but not all) types of bacteria in that sample, and the bacteria are eventually counted.

The ratio of these gasses determines whether a person is predominantly a hydrogen or methane producer. When it comes to SIBO, these gasses could also provide clues to which microbes are thriving (overgrowing) in the small intestine.[PMID:34190027]While hydrogen is produced primarily by bacteria, most methane is produced by another group of microbes called Archaea, which belong to a domain of life separate from Bacteria or Eukarya (the cells that make up complex organisms, such as humans.) Archaea in the human gut consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide for energy, generating methane as a result, which is why they’re also known as methanogens.[PMID:34190027]An estimated third of healthy adults produce more methane than hydrogen, so methane hasn’t been identified as a clear cause of GI symptoms. Recent theories suggest that methane plays a role in constipation by slowing the GI system, however, and suggest differentiating between  intestinal methanogen overgrowth and SIBO.[PMID:34190027] A recent meta-analysis reported that the odds of having methane-positive SIBO (possibly indicating methanogen overgrowth) were approximately two to three times higher in constipation-predominant IBS compared with diarrhea-predominant or mixed IBS, according to data from five studies.[PMID:34190027]Other research indicates that individuals with methane-positive breath tests are five times more likely to have constipation than people who primarily produce hydrogen.[PMID:28323273] However, because slowing down of the GI system may support the growth of methanogens, it’s unclear which comes first: the methanogens or the constipation.[PMID:34190027]",

However, a number of factors can reduce the accuracy of breath tests and lead to a false positive or false negative.[PMID:28323273]The person being tested could reduce the accuracy of the test in the following ways:- Using antibiotics within 4 weeks of testing- Using laxatives or gut-motility drugs within a week of testing- Not fasting long enough (8 to 12 hours) before the test- Eating fermentable foods, such as complex carbohydrates, the day before the test- Smoking before the testThe carbohydrate used during the test also affects the results. Glucose is more likely to lead to a false negative than lactulose, but glucose is regarded as a more accurate diagnostic tool. Lactulose is more likely to lead to a false positive by quickly reaching the large intestine, where hydrogen will be produced. Using too large a dose can speed up intestinal transit even more, leading to an early peak in gas production that could lead to a false positive.[PMID:31743632][PMID:28323273]Clinicians and researchers may also set their own cutoffs for the level of gas production required to diagnose SIBO, which would obviously have an impact on results.[PMID:28323273]",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/906/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/551/edit,Creatine,How does creatine work?,"Creatine works mainly through its effects on energy metabolism. *Adenosine triphosphate* (ATP) is a molecule that carries energy within cells and is the main fuel source for high-intensity exercise. When cells use ATP for energy, this molecule is converted into *adenosine diphosphate* (ADP) and *adenosine monophosphate* (AMP). Creatine exists in cells in the form of creatine phosphate (or phosphocreatine), which donates a high-energy phosphate group to ADP, thus turning this molecule back into ATP.By increasing the overall pool of cellular phosphocreatine, supplementation with creatine can accelerate the recycling of ADP into ATP, thereby quickly replenishing cellular energy stores. This increased availability of energy can promote improvements in strength and power output.[PMID:9414070] The pro-energetic properties of creatine don’t just affect skeletal muscle, but nearly all body systems, including the central nervous system (which comprises the brain and spinal cord).[PMID:21448658]",

DHEA is the form that is transported into the tissues to be converted into the sex hormones (e.g., androgens and estrogens). Both DHEA and DHEA-S decrease significantly with age, with people in their 70s having less than 20% of the peak DHEA-S levels of young adults.[PMID:23417481][PMID:17362047][PMID:7962278][PMID:1400863] Since DHEA and DHEA-S are the most abundant circulating steroids in the body, and they decline with age, there is speculation that supplementation with DHEA and/or DHEA-S may reduce age-related declines in health.[PMID:23417481][PMID:34935937]",

The primary mechanism by which taurine acts as an antioxidant is unclear. Taurine may have the ability to directly scavenge free radicals,[PMID: 20360629] but it’s more likely that taurine works by regulating antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.[PMID: 30211983][PMID: 34184084][PMID:21691752]Taurine may provide cardioprotective effects by decreasing oxidative stress and a few other mechanisms. It can modify blood lipids by binding to bile acids and facilitating the breakdown and excretion of cholesterol.[PMID: 34184084][PMID: 32871172] Additionally, it reduces blood pressure by enhancing vasodilation (i.e., by relaxing of blood vessels), leading to an increase in blood flow.[PMID: 26781281][PMID: 29200904] Taurine may also reduce blood pressure by reducing the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.[PMID: 32957558]Muscle contraction is triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Taurine may improve physical performance by increasing the calcium-storing ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as increasing the sensitivity of force-generating proteins (i.e., actin and myosin) to calcium, thus increasing muscle force.[PMID: 34039357][PMID: 25123198]With special reference to endurance exercise, taurine may aid performance by increasing the use of fat for fuel and reducing the contribution from [glycogen], as well as improving mitochondrial function.[PMID: 34039357]",

When taken as a supplement, CII is usually in one of two forms: undenatured or hydrolyzed. Undenatured collagen has been minimally processed at a low temperature to keep its peptides mostly intact. Hydrolyzed CII has been processed with a higher degree of heat, acid, and enzymes, resulting in the breakdown of peptides from larger forms into smaller ones.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/957/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/266/edit,Type-II Collagen,What are type II collagen’s main drawbacks?,"By and large, CII seems fairly safe. One potential concern is that collagen (in dosages of around 10 grams per day) has been shown to increase oxalate levels in urine, likely because collagen consists of approximately 10% hydroxyproline, and a major metabolite of hydroxyproline is oxalate. As a result, higher doses of CII could increase the risk of oxalate-based [kidney stones] in susceptible individuals.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/958/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/266/edit,Type-II Collagen,How does type II collagen work?,"Undenatured CII has been proposed to improve joint pain through an effect on the immune system. More specifically, CII peptides are thought to induce the formation of *regulatory T cells* (Tregs) in areas of the gut known as Preyer’s patches. These Tregs can enter circulation, where they produce anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g., IL-10), which in theory can inhibit inflammation and tissue damage in joints.The hydrolysis of type II collagen seems to result in the breakdown of the most immunologically active peptides, meaning that the effect of hydrolyzed collagen on joints may not act via this mechanism. However, in higher doses, hydrolyzed CII might improve joint pain by supplying the amino acids used to repair the damaged tissue.",

National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) updated 2022 Nov 8; cited 2023 May 24]Since vitamin D production in the skin is self-limiting, sun exposure is unlikely to produce vitamin D levels that cause harm (although it may be possible for people with constant, high-level sun exposure, e.g., lifeguards, to synthesize harmfully high levels of Vitamin D).[PMID: 7424691] However, vitamin D levels in the blood can readily reach toxic levels with chronic, high-level supplementation.Although ultra-high-level supplementation is universally considered to be toxic, there’s some debate on what constitutes the upper limit for safe, “moderate-level” supplementation. Taking around 4,000 IU (100 μg) of vitamin D per day for extended periods (≥6 months) seems to increase the risk of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) and, among older adults, the likelihood of experiencing a fall.[PMID: 36853379] A few trials on older adults have found that vitamin D increased the risk of falls,[PMID: 26747333][PMID: 33284677] and one study observed a decrease in [bone mineral density] among women taking high doses of vitamin D.[PMID: 32777104]",

Upon binding vitamin D, the VDR functions as a transcription factor, regulating the activity of over 1,000 different genes.[PMID: 27454349] This “genomic” action of vitamin D tends to be slower-acting, requiring the synthesis of new mRNA and proteins to take effect. Vitamin D also works through “non-genomic” mechanisms, causing rapid activation of various signaling pathways within the cell. Although VDRs have been identified on cell membranes, it isn’t currently known whether the more rapid, non-genomic action of vitamin D occurs through membrane-associated vitamin D receptors or a different cellular receptor.[PMID: 32654294]Although the most commonly associated effects of  vitamin D on the body are associated with bone metabolism, the almost ubiquitous presence of VDRs in cells and tissues throughout the body indicates that vitamin D can affect a wide range of physiological processes.[PMID: 35405966] The additional effects of vitamin D on the body include, but aren’t limited to, the following:[PMID: 36820164]- Anticancer effects (promotion of cell death or suppressing proliferation in cancer cells)- Brain development[PMID: 22796576]- Cell differentiation[PMID: 19545951][PMID: 17641030]- Anti-inflammatory effects[PMID: 26827961]- Antioxidant effects[PMID: 30907059]- Antibacterial effects (through vitamin D’s effects on immune cells, and its promotion of  the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides)[PMID: 23857223]- Blood vessel protection[PMID: 28825325]- Nervous system health- Calcium regulation",

All the other vitamins are water-soluble.- Fat solubility affects two primary things: how well the vitamin is absorbed with fat-containing meals, and how long it’s stored in your body.Being fat-soluble is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you can store those vitamins in your body fat and liver, which means you don’t necessarily need daily intake. A sunny vacation can provide you with enough stored vitamin D to last you weeks or even months.[PMID: 23308207]On the other hand, you can accidentally overdose on these vitamins more easily. Case studies of vitamin A overdose are actually not that uncommon. Eating the livers of some large fish, seals, or polar bears can easily cause vitamin A poisoning.[PMID:3356407][PMID:10584420][PMID:16747610]But most of us don’t eat shark liver or polar bear liver, and vitamin D overdose[PMID:18290725] is less common than vitamin A overdose. In the context of vitamin D intake solely from dietary sources (and not supplements), our problem is less likely to be overdosing on fat-soluble vitamins than it is to be getting enough of them. Let’s take a look at how to get enough vitamin D by taking it with the right amount of fat.[sidebar]Vitamin D is one of four fat-soluble vitamins. We don’t need daily intake, since it's stored in body fat, but as many people are low in vitamin D, knowing how much fat you need can be very helpful.[/sidebar]Some people take a vitamin-D-containing multivitamin in the morning, either with coffee or on an empty stomach. Others take a multivitamin with three eggs and buttered coffee. Whether or not either of these is ideal is an open question. It is commonly assumed that vitamin D is better absorbed when taken with a low to moderate amount of fat, as compared to no fat or lots of fat, based on an often-noted study. Specifically, researchers have shown that in people given a single, large dose of vitamin D, taking it with 11 grams of fat leads to higher levels of vitamin D in the bloodstream, compared to taking it with either 35 grams or 0 grams — absorption was 16% higher and 20% higher, respectively.[PMID: 23427007] An important caveat to this work is that these apparent differences in absorption were only noted by measuring plasma vitamin D levels 12 hours after taking a single large dose of 50,000 IU (1,250 μg). When plasma vitamin D levels were assessed one month and three months after this large dose, the groups didn’t significantly differ in their levels of circulating vitamin D. One alternative interpretation of this work is therefore that vitamin D may be well-absorbed regardless of the amount of fat it is taken with, or on an empty stomach. Changes in plasma vitamin D levels 12 hours postdose with respect to dietary fat content may simply reflect altered *rates* of absorption into the bloodstream, rather than increased or decreased absolute absorption, as is commonly inferred from the data. Examining plasma vitamin D levels after a single dose at earlier (<12 hours) and later times (>12 hours) might have shed more light on this.  Another possibility, given that participants in the above study had the same blood vitamin D levels regardless of whether they took it with some additional fat, is that the limiting factor for achieving long-term steady state vitamin D levels in the blood is more dependent on absorption of vitamin D into the tissues over time, and less on achieving maximal acute vitamin D levels in the blood after a single dose. The ability of fat to acutely enhance blood vitamin D suggests that fat may enhance intestinal absorption. However, it’s not clear that this ultimately matters in terms of achieving stable, steady-state blood vitamin D levels over a longer period of  time. In other words, simply taking vitamin D may be more important than what it is taken with. The same researchers did a later study that showed 32% higher plasma vitamin D levels when people took a large dose with a meal containing 30 grams of fat, compared to a fat-free meal. But again, they used a single large dose of 50,000 IU of vitamin D.[PMID:25441954] Although they tested blood vitamin D levels at additional acute time-points (10, 12, and 14 hours), testing at additional timepoints beyond 14 hours (ideally, 24-48 hours, while the vitamin D meal was still present in the intestines) would have been necessary to see whether or not the plasma levels of the people who ate the fat-free meal ever reached those of those who ate the fatty meal, as one would expect if the effect of a fatty meal is to expedite the intestinal uptake of vitamin D. Unfortunately, the study authors failed to perform any longer-term followup. More research is therefore needed to better understand interactions between meal fat content and vitamin D absorption. Taking the evidence all together, it is safe to say that vitamin D is absorbed well enough no matter which type of meal (or no meal) it is taken with. Since vitamin D is stored in body fat, the apparent effects of meal fat content relative to changes in acute absorption may ultimately be less important than regular consumption to support optimal steady-state levels.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1095/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/8/edit,Mental Health,Can vitamin D cure depression?,"Many people get depressed during the winter months, when we produce less vitamin D. So, can supplemental vitamin D cure seasonal depression, and maybe other types of depression? No, alas — but it may help.Vitamin D is the “sunshine vitamin”,[PMID:22629085] and sunshine is implicated in mood. So it makes sense that researchers have intently explored vitamin D supplementation for depression. But depression is complex, and the mechanisms at work are not well-understood. However, careful analysis of the trials testing the effects of vitamin D on depression and mood-related pathways will help provide some insight into whether, or if, vitamin D may be helpful for depression in different contexts or populations. Two reviews of observational studies and intervention trials reached the same conclusions: When parsing the observational data, both reviews found a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D (≤20 ng/mL). When parsing the trial data, both reviews found benefits from supplementation, but also assessed some of the included studies as having low methodological quality and high risk of bias.[PMID:27750060][PMID:26951286]Those two reviews were published in 2017 and 2016, so shortly after a 2015 meta-analysis of [glossary:randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials] (RCTs) reported finding no significant reduction in depression after vitamin D supplementation. Its authors, however, mentioned that “most of the studies focused on individuals with low levels of depression and sufficient serum vitamin D at baseline”.[PMID:25701329] In other words, they didn’t rule out the possibility that in people with higher levels of depression or lower levels of vitamin D, supplementation might be more effective.This hypothesis lines up with the conclusions of a 2014 meta-analysis, which found that, if one considered only the studies whose subjects had low levels of vitamin D at baseline (≤20 ng/mL) and were then given enough vitamin D to achieve sufficiency over the course of the trial, then supplemental vitamin D was about as effective as antidepressant medication.[PMID:24732019] However, this meta-analysis did not account for [publication bias].A 2018 meta-analysis focused on major depression and found a moderate benefit from vitamin D. However, it stresses the low number of qualifying studies (four trials) and, like the 2017 and 2016 reviews, deplores the low methodological quality of some of the studies.[PMID:29943744] Additionally, a 2016 randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in people with major depressive disorder purportedly saw an antidepressant effect,[PMID: 26609167] but this study was retracted in 2021 due to concerns over the validity of the participant data.[PMID: 33974698]Finally, let’s mention a 2016 RCT that found that pregnant women who took a daily dose of 2,000 IU (50 μg) of vitamin D3 during late pregnancy had lower scores on a [postpartum depression] screening scale than those who did not supplement.[PMID:27544544] However, this study only addressed postpartum depression in healthy women with a low-to-moderate pre-partum risk of depression; it may not have wider applicability, and further research is needed. Vitamin D insufficiency (≤20 ng/mL) has been associated with depression. If your depression is severe, you are more likely to benefit from correcting an insufficiency. If your levels of vitamin D are sufficient, however, then whether your depression is severe or not, supplementation isn’t likely to help. (Due to the poor overall methodological quality of the studies, those conclusions are at best preliminary.)In support of this, a number of observational studies have found that people with depression are more likely to have low vitamin D levels.[PMID: 37098201] However, randomized controlled trials don’t consistently find beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression.[PMID: 22073146][PMID: 22205149] One reason for this could be that benefits only occur if a person has sufficiently severe depression symptoms. In support of this, two meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the severity of depression symptoms in people with depression but had no effect on depression symptoms in people without depression.[PMID: 37852593][PMID: 36716601]Vitamin D receptors can be found pretty much everywhere in the human body, so the ways in which vitamin D might affect your mood are innumerable. One of those mechanisms could be hormonal, since vitamin D helps regulate testosterone levels,[PMID:21154195][PMID:20050857] and since low testosterone can impair the mood of both men[PMID:25999864][PMID:24016385][PMID:19707253][PMID:19625884] and women.[PMID:26358173]We should remember, however, that correlation is not causation. As stated above, the observational data suggests a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D, but that doesn’t mean that low levels of vitamin D cause the depression. It might be that depressed people go outside less, thus getting less sunlight, thus producing less vitamin D: the depression would then be the cause of the low vitamin D levels, rather than its consequence.Even if depression is a consequence, not a cause, it doesn’t mean that low levels of vitamin D aren’t *also* a consequence. People who go outside less get less sunlight, but also probably less exercise — and we know that exercise benefits mood,[PMID:16862239] both directly and [by promoting better sleep](https://examine.com/nutrition/ten-tips-for-better-sleep/##6-exercise).And of course, a consequence can have more than one cause. For instance, a decrease in vitamin D production during the winter months is a possible factor in *seasonal affective disorder* (SAD),[PMID:26688752] but so is a decrease in illumination,[PMID:26655862] since one meta-analysis[PMID:15800134] and a more recent RCT[PMID:16648320] found that [light therapy] (using visible light, free of the UVB rays that allow your skin to produce vitamin D) can improve SAD symptoms, often as much as can pharmaceuticals. It should be noted, however, that a few trials with small sample sizes make for rather weak evidence, especially since the meta-analysis didn’t account for publication bias.The findings on vitamin D are less consistent. One study found an association between depression and seasonal changes in vitamin D,[PMID:25791903] but another study found no effect of supplemental vitamin D on SAD.[PMID:25125215] And compounding the uncertainty, the researchers of both studies stressed that potential confounders were numerous.To summarize:- Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression, but it doesn’t follow that low levels of vitamin D are the *cause* of the depression. They’re probably one of the factors at play in seasonal depression, but so is the decrease in illumination.- If your vitamin D levels are *not* low, supplementation isn’t likely to benefit your mood. If they *are* low, supplementation is more likely to help if you suffer from major depression.- If you suspect your vitamin D levels are low, you can have them assessed through a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test. Assessing your vitamin D levels twice in a year — in midsummer and midwinter, when there is the most and least sunlight — is an efficient way of estimating what your levels are around the year.",

Two factors have been proposed as possible explanations:[PMID:31069788]1. People may not be appropriately using sunscreen during periods of sun exposure (i.e., incorrect type, amount, SPF, or application frequency). If not used correctly, UVB rays could easily reach areas of your skin where sunscreen is absent or where coverage is not sufficient enough.2. While sunscreen does a good job of blocking most UVB rays, it doesn’t entirely block them. A high amount of exposure to UVB rays is not required to kickstart vitamin D production in the skin. So, it’s possible that low amounts of UVB radiation could get past the sunscreen to initiate vitamin D creation.One important caveat — studies to date have generally been conducted on people with less skin pigmentation (i.e., those with Fitzpatrick skin types 1–3).

Sun exposure can be bolstered with vitamin D rich foods and supplements to attain sufficient levels.[/sidebar]Your body can produce [vitamin D] when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays.[PMID:21664236] Yet it is these rays that sunscreens are designed to primarily block.[PMID:28038885] So will using sunscreen tank your vitamin D levels?# Sunscreen and vitamin D production  #Sunscreen can decrease vitamin D production under both controlled laboratory testing and real-world conditions.[PMID:22512875][PMID:26977044] This decrease is most notable if sunscreen is used consistently and properly (i.e., when using a broad-spectrum sunscreen, the right *sun protection factor* (SPF), amount, and reapplication schedule).[PMID:28718005][PMID:24313722][PMID:30945275] Yet, the amount to which sunscreen decreases vitamin D production appears to be small — a counterintuitive finding.[PMID:31069788] How could this be? Two factors have been proposed as possible explanations:[PMID:31069788]1. People may not be appropriately using sunscreen during periods of sun exposure (i.e., incorrect type, amount, SPF, or application frequency). If not used correctly, UVB rays could easily reach areas of your skin where sunscreen is absent or where coverage is not sufficient enough.2. While sunscreen does a good job of blocking most UVB rays, it doesn’t entirely block them. A high amount of exposure to UVB rays is not required to kickstart vitamin D production in the skin. So, it’s possible that low amounts of UVB radiation could get past the sunscreen to initiate vitamin D creation.One important caveat — studies to date have generally been conducted on people with less skin pigmentation (i.e., those with Fitzpatrick skin types 1–3). A different result may be seen in those with Fitzpatrick skin types 4–6.",

Roughly 10,000 years ago, mutations emerged that allowed for increased LCT gene activity in adulthood,[PMID:26404364] which is technically called ‘lactase persistence’. People with this mutation, which is most common among people of Northern European descent, can digest milk sugar into adulthood. Mutations persist when they confer benefits. Some of the ancestral humans with this mutation benefited from their mutant superpower ability to digest milk sugar into adulthood. Why would that be? In a word, pastoralism. Raising livestock can provide for a steady supply of meat and milk, and certain geographies were set up well for animal husbandry.[PMID:29999504]One of those regions, Sweden, provides some interesting data. Nearly all modern Swedish people can digest lactose, but as little as 4,000-5,000 years ago, there was a stark divergence in that area: DNA from Swedish hunter-gatherer populations of that era show only 5% to have had lactase persistence, while DNA from cattle-raising populations of the same era show 75% with lactase persistence.[PMID:22643754] If you’re a modern-day Swede, you probably owe your milk-digesting ability to the success of the latter population.",

Frequently, breath methane is measured along with hydrogen, and a rise of ≥10 ppm in breath methane is considered positive.[PMID:30783042] Both hydrogen and methane are byproducts of bacterial metabolism; a sizeable increase in one or both after fasted lactose ingestion indicates that the lactose the patient drank is available to their intestinal bacteria for fermentation, and is therefore not being broken down in the small intestine.

Throughout life, both internal (e.g., genetics and hormones) and external (e.g., exercise and diet) factors are continually modeling and remodeling bones. The remodeling occurs via a complex and carefully orchestrated interplay between bone resorption (bone breakdown) and bone deposition (bone formation). Bone mass, i. e., the amount of minerals in the bone, reflects the interplay between these two processes.Most bone mass is accrued early in life, with peak bone mass achieved by the age of 30. In later life, bone remodeling continues, but more bone is generally lost than gained. However, this doesn’t mean bone health can’t improve at any age. In fact, it is estimated that most of the adult skeleton is replaced every ten years, and lifestyle choices can modify the strength and health of these “new” bones.",

Results of a BMD test are presented as “normal”, “low bone mass”, “osteoporosis”, and “severe or established osteoporosis”.Other measures that may be used to assess bone health include imaging (e.g., X-rays), genetic testing, and blood tests for hormones (e.g., growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, cortisol, and sex hormones); markers of bone turnover (e.g., C-telopeptide crosslink, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen); and certain nutrients (e.g., [vitamin D] and [calcium]).",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1219/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1114/edit,Bone Health,Can vitamin D supplements improve bone health?,"Maybe, but most likely only in people who have low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is essential for [calcium] absorption in the small intestine. When vitamin D levels are too low, blood calcium levels fall, and more calcium is released from bones to maintain circulating calcium levels in the body. Over time, this process results in bone demineralization[PMID:22254049] and increases the risk of fractures. Prolonged and severe vitamin D deficiency can result in a condition known as rickets (in children) and osteomalacia (in adults), which is characterized by bone pain, soft bones, and skeletal deformities.Although severe vitamin D deficiency is somewhat rare in middle- and high-income countries, suboptimal vitamin D levels are not uncommon, likely because of low sun exposure (which decreases the skin’s synthesis of vitamin D) and inadequate dietary intake (very few foods naturally contain vitamin D). Thus, it is plausible that vitamin D supplementation may improve bone health in certain people, but the results to date are mixed.In some studies, supplementation with up to 800 IU/day of vitamin D reduced the risk of bone fractures in select individuals, such as those with low baseline levels of vitamin D and older adults.[PMID:15886381][PMID:19307517] There is also evidence that combining vitamin D supplementation with calcium may improve BMD.[PMID:17264183][PMID:20068257] Conversely, two large trials found that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on bone structure, BMD, or fracture incidence in healthy older adults.[PMID:31923341][PMID:35939577]",

One way to achieve this is through progressive, high-load resistance training.[PMID:27840033] For the best effects, it’s important to utilize a heavy load (80%–85% of your maximal strength), perform training at least twice per week, and involve major muscle groups. High-impact, high-load exercises, such as jumping, bounding, skipping, drop jumps, and (to some extent) running, are also effective for stimulating bone. Incorporating these exercises 4–7 times per week at a dose of 10–50 “impacts” per day appears to be optimal.[PMID:20004758] Combining high-impact exercise with [vitamin D] and [calcium] or progressive resistance training can lead to further improvements in bone health.Walking is often recommended as a way to maintain bone health. However, some meta-analyses suggest that walking has minimal to no effects on BMD, likely because the impact isn’t high enough.[PMID:24149921][PMID:18602880] In addition, prolonged endurance exercises like swimming, and cycling — while beneficial for cardiovascular health — provide very little osteogenic (bone-forming) activity.[PMID:30513557]",

Among these age-related concerns, the increased risk of osteoporosis is the most common cause of bone disease in older adults.This is because approximately 90% of our bone mass is acquired between birth and 20 years of age.[PMID:29052784] Peak bone mass is maintained in men until their early 40s, and in women until their late 30s, at which point BMD begins to decline. The decline begins earlier in women due to the hormonal changes that occur during perimenopause and menopause, especially the decline in [estrogen].[PMID:34532328]After age 60, the rate of BMD loss in both men and women is around 1%–1.5% each year, and, by age 70, around 30%–40% of total bone mass is lost.[PMID:34532328] People who achieve a higher peak bone mass early in life are at a significantly reduced risk of [osteoporosis].

For one, gut dysbiosis impairs the absorption of [calcium] in the intestines. Additionally, several gut-derived metabolites exert control over cells that are responsible for bone turnover. Finally, gut-dysbiosis-induced intestinal permeability causes the release of inflammatory cytokines into the bloodstream, which can negatively affect BMD and other bone-health-related factors.[Prebiotics] and [probiotics] have been investigated for their ability to improve bone health via their effects on the gut microbiome. While more research is needed, some evidence suggests that probiotic supplementation may protect against the loss of BMD and improve markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women.[PMID:35203401]Modulation of the gut microbiota through other means, such as diet, [synbiotics], [postbiotics], antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, is another avenue through which the gut-bone axis can be targeted to improve bone health.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1278/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1071/edit,Obesity,What is metabolically healthy obesity?,"*Metabolically healthy obesity* (MHO) refers to a subset of people with a [BMI] ≥30 who display a relatively normal metabolic profile and a reduced risk of disease when compared to people with a BMI ≥30 who have the more typical profile of increased cardiometabolic risk, which is referred to as *metabolically unhealthy obesity* (MUO).[PMID:32128581][PMID:33961041] Basically, people with MHO don’t seem to have increased cardiometabolic risk despite their elevated BMI.While the general concept of MHO is clear, standardized criteria have yet to be defined. In fact, more than 30 different definitions of MHO have been used in the scientific literature.[PMID:31524630] Most definitions are based on the criteria for [metabolic syndrome] outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III,[PMID:16157765] with the presence of 2 or less of the 5 metabolic syndrome components commonly qualifying as MHO. Consequently, MHO is a misnomer of sorts — people with MHO are typically not truly healthy; they just have fewer cardiometabolic abnormalities than their MUO peers. People with MHO may lack certain cardiometabolic risk factors,[PMID:32869512] but still generally have a higher risk of [cardiovascular disease],[PMID:34251088][PMID:33708824] [type 2 diabetes],[PMID:35211245] [nonalcoholic fatty liver disease],[PMID:32349939][PMID:33973273] and [all-cause mortality][PMID:32869512][PMID:34109441][PMID:4297192] than people who are metabolically healthy and have a normal BMI.To cast further doubt on the seemingly benign nature of MHO, evidence suggests that MHO is not a stable condition and 30%–50% of people with MHO transition to MUO after 4 to 20 years of follow-up.[PMID:31524630] In a large prospective cohort study published in 2018, only about 15% of women with MHO at baseline remained metabolically healthy over 20 years of follow-up.[PMID:29859908]Lastly, several observational studies have found that increased liver fat is a crucial risk factor for cardiometabolic disease and is associated with an increased risk of transitioning from MHO to MUO;[PMID:28508194][PMID:31245932][PMID:32147361][PMID:27474900] however, very few studies have considered liver fat as part of the criteria for MHO.In sum, MHO is a misleading term on the basis of the common criteria used to classify it. People with MHO may be at a lower risk of cardiometabolic disease than people with MUO, but their risk is still higher than that of  people who are metabolically healthy and have a normal BMI.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1321/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1154/edit,Constipation,Does the type of fiber matter when it comes to constipation?,"Increasing fiber intake is a common recommendation for people with constipation. But the effects of fiber likely depend on what *type* of fiber is added.Quite a few studies have looked at whether fiber is beneficial for constipation by assessing its ability to increase the number of stools a person passes in a week. And while a greater defecation frequency can be an indicator of benefit, it doesn’t always mean the unpleasant aspects of constipation — like abdominal pain — are actually improved. When looking solely at patient-assessed constipation symptoms (things like stomach discomfort, [bloating], painful bowel movements, and straining during defecation), several randomized controlled trials have reported no clear benefits from fiber supplementation. This was the finding of a 3-week trial using *galacto-oligosaccharides* (GOS; 5.5 or 11 grams per day),[PMID:35057489] a 2-week study using polydextrose (4, 8, or 12 grams per day),[PMID:30791557] and a 4-week study using wheat bran (12.5 grams of fiber per day).[PMID:7851201]Conversely, some randomized controlled trials have reported improvements to patient-reported constipation symptoms from fiber supplements. Several trials on [psyllium] supplementation (typically in dosages of 10–20 grams of fiber per day) have reported reductions in straining[PMID:34081625][PMID:3530306] and pain during defecation.[PMID:34081625][PMID:8824651] One 4-week trial likewise found supplementation with 24 grams of pectin (a fiber found in various fruits and vegetables) led to reductions in constipation symptoms, including less bloating.[PMID:25623312]This then raises the question: what is it about fibers like psyllium and pectin that makes them good at improving symptoms? The answer may be viscosity.Fiber is believed to benefit constipation in large part by binding water in the intestines, thereby softening the stool and making it move more smoothly through the intestines. Both pectin and psyllium are very effective at binding water, which means they should increase the hydration of feces. This water-binding property, known as viscosity, varies depending on the fiber in question. Other viscous fibers and fiber-sources with evidence of benefit for constipation include [flaxseed|flaxseeds],[PMID:30661699] partially hydrolyzed [guar gum],[PMID:24711073][PMID:25843197] [β-glucan|beta-glucans] (e.g., from [oats]),[PMID:34236436][PMID:18382081] and [inulin].[PMID:21091293][PMID:27492975]Finally, it’s worth noting that many types of fiber (both viscous and non-viscous) are readily fermentable by intestinal bacteria. This can result in significant gas production, potentially leading to gastrointestinal effects like flatulence and bloating, especially in susceptible individuals or when high amounts are consumed. Among the viscous fibers, inulin seems to be one of the most fermentable,[PMID:33208922] whereas psyllium tends to be one of the least fermentable.[PMID:25972619]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1322/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1154/edit,Constipation,Does a low-carbohydrate diet increase the risk of constipation?,"There isn’t much research looking at whether low-carbohydrate diets increase the risk of constipation, though a few studies suggest they can lead some people to develop constipation.One 24-week randomized controlled trial assigned 120 people to follow either a low-carbohydrate or low fat diet for the purposes of weight loss.[PMID:15148063] Ultimately, more people self-reported constipation on the low-carbohydrate diet (68%) than on the low-fat diet (35%).Another randomized controlled trial had 135 people follow either a low-carbohydrate diet or a low-fat, higher-fiber diet, with both being fairly low calorie (around 1,000–1,400 calories per day).[PMID:3021006] After three months, 23% of participants assigned to the low-carbohydrate diet had reported constipation, compared to only 3% on the low-fat, higher-fiber diet.Finally, a three-month randomized controlled trial assigned 34 people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes to either a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet or a calorie restricted diet based on diet guidelines by the American Diabetes Association.[PMID:24717684] By the end of the study, participants on the low-carbohydrate diet reported an increase in constipation symptoms.Why exactly a low-carbohydrate diet might lead to constipation is unclear, but given that *in practice* such diets often lead people to eat less fiber,[PMID:35730148] it’s reasonable to wonder if this is a factor. In line with this, one of the three previously referenced trials assessed participants’ fiber intake, reporting that fiber intake decreased in the low-carbohydrate diet (from 17.1 to 13.9 grams per day), whereas it very slightly increased in the low-fat group (from 17.4 to 18.6 grams per day).[PMID:3021006]Of course, it’s important to note that all studies were in the context of people losing weight (and all studies reported greater weight loss with the low-carbohydrate diet), meaning the low-carbohydrate diet involved calorie restriction. Whether a non-calorically reduced low-carbohydrate diet has the same effect on constipation is therefore not as clear.Constipation is also a frequently reported side effect of ketogenic diets for childhood epilepsy.[PMID:30403286]",

Under resting conditions, immune cells such as lymphocytes burn a combination of proteins, fats, and glucose for energy. During an active immune response, much of the fatty and amino acids that are utilized as fuel under resting conditions are instead used to synthesize proteins and lipids required for cell growth, causing an increased reliance on glucose metabolism for fuel.[PMID:32105390] The flexibility required to undergo this whole-sale metabolic shift from oxidative metabolism under resting conditions to glycolysis when the immune system becomes activated is an important factor for immune health. There is mounting evidence that immune cell function tends to suffer when “metabolic flexibility” is impaired.[PMID:32913271]Healthy regulation of glucose homeostasis is key to ensuring adequate glucose supply to the cells and tissues that need it. When glucose homeostasis is impaired, the body is less able to maintain blood sugar levels within a healthy range, which can have negative effects on immune health. Many of the effects of impaired glucose homeostasis on immune health have been brought to light through research on *[type 2 diabetes]* (T2D): people with T2D are less able to fight off invading pathogens.[PMID:31657690] *Hyperglycemia* (abnormally high blood sugar) can also impair the immune response by affecting the immune system’s ability to induce[PMID:27042306] or resolve[PMID:19538479] inflammation. Glucose is a reactive molecule that causes chemical modifications to proteins if it is allowed to accumulate to toxic levels in the blood.[PMID:24634591] Animal studies have suggested that hyperglycemia may promote autoimmunity through the chemical modification of *major histocompatibility complex* (MHC) class II proteins in immune cells,[PMID:33725478] which play a role in sensing and responding to foreign pathogens.

These conditions include coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and others. CVD typically occurs due to an ischemic disruption of normal perfusion (blood flow). Most commonly, the cause of CVD is [atherosclerosis]; however, disruption in perfusion can be also caused by other factors such as blood clots from [atrial fibrillation] or heart valve damage after rheumatic fever.[PMID:30571040]  - CAD is also known as coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD). In CAD, decreased myocardial perfusion (i.e., less blood flow to the heart muscle) can cause angina (chest pain) and *myocardial infarction* (MI, colloquially known as a “heart attack”). When chest pain occurs with exertion and stops after rest and/or medication, it is considered stable angina. However, when chest pain occurs unpredictably, including at rest, it is known as unstable angina and can be a medical emergency which can develop into an MI.[PMID:33231974]- Cerebrovascular disease is the disruption of perfusion into the brain and includes ischemic and hemorrhagic [stroke] and also transient ischemic attack (TIA), Ischemic stroke and TIA are caused by ACVD and share the same risk factors as CAD (above).[PMID:28613677]- PVD, also called peripheral arterial disease (PAD), is caused by reduced perfusion to the lower limbs, caused by atherosclerosis. PVD most commonly presents with symptoms of [intermittent claudication] with walking.[PMID:32491414]- Other types of CVD include [heart failure], [arrhythmia], [aortic aneurysm], inflammatory heart disease (such as [myocarditis]), and heart valve disease (e.g. valvular stenosis).

These hormones, alongside other metabolic changes, make the pregnant parent’s body less responsive to [insulin], the hormone that allows glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the body’s cells.[PMID:25584208] This is called [insulin resistance]. Normally, the pancreas secretes more insulin to combat this resistance and keep blood glucose under control. However, in some pregnant people, the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance.[PMID:27208340][PMID:30373146] This causes blood sugar levels to rise beyond what is considered a healthy range and results in a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.",

Blood tests will be performed to analyze levels of thyroid hormones and check for the presence of particular autoantibodies. Diagnosis can be confirmed through radioactive iodine uptake testing. The thyroid gland absorbs [iodine] to make thyroid hormones, and in people with Graves’ disease, overproduction of thyroid hormones increases iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which can be measured with a thyroid scan. Doctors will also use the thyroid scan to analyze the pattern of iodine uptake, which can help to distinguish Graves’ disease from other thyroid disorders.[PMID:32059832]",

However, there are treatment options for hyperthyroidism, including surgery, medications, and radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine therapy involves ingestion of a radioactive form of iodine, which destroys the cells in the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers can reduce some of the symptoms of Graves’ disease, such as rapid heartbeat, tremors, and nervousness. Antithyroid medications that work by reducing the production of thyroid hormones are also commonly prescribed. Surgery is another common treatment for hyperthyroidism and involves removing part or most of the thyroid gland. [PMID:32059832]",

Commonly used antithyroid therapies are associated with an increased risk that disease symptoms will return after treatment is stopped. The downside to ablative therapies such as radioiodine therapy or surgery is that many people will eventually develop hypothyroidism, which will require lifelong hormone therapy. Immunotherapies designed to treat the underlying autoimmune process that causes Graves’ disease are under development and are being designed with the goal of restoring immune tolerance to some of the self-proteins targeted by autoimmunity. If these immunotherapies are successful, stopping the underlying autoimmune process could potentially restore thyroid hormones back to normal, healthy levels without inducing hypothyroidism.

Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system loses tolerance to “self” molecules and instead interprets them as harmful invaders and targets the tissues where they’re present. The mechanisms that break self-tolerance in Graves’ disease are not clear. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, loss of tolerance to “self” is likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It has been proposed that the thyroid proteins targeted by the immune system in people with Graves’ disease may have properties that contribute to loss of immune tolerance.[PMID: 24091783] However, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Although several animal models are known to develop autoimmunity against the thyroid gland,[PMID: 19522731] they differ from Graves’ disease in that these models are associated with different antibodies and do not develop hyperthyroidism.[PMID: 24091783]Loss of self-tolerance may also occur via common mechanisms across different autoimmune diseases because up to 25% of people with one autoimmune disorder tend to develop additional ones.[PMID:21977137] This phenomenon has also been observed for Graves’ disease, in which 20% of patients also have at least one additional autoimmune disorder.[PMID:30639646]",

More specifically, sauna has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, modulate immune and autonomic nervous system activity, and improve blood lipid and hormone levels.[PMID:30077204] One especially noteworthy characteristic of sauna is its role as a “hormetic stressor”: it puts a mild stress on the body, which provokes cellular processes that encourage repair and protection from future stressors (a phenomenon known as hormesis). Exercise is another form of hormetic stressor, and indeed, sauna and exercise have very similar (but not identical) physiological effects,[PMID: 34363927] which include an increase in heart rate (120–150 beats per minute) and an elevation in skin and skeletal muscle blood flow, among others.It’s worth remembering that, alongside its physiological effects, sauna is also simply a relaxing and pleasurable activity (with cultural significance for many); engaging in such activities is likely to benefit health in its own right.",

Colloquially, however, sauna can mean a variety of forms of passive heat exposure, including ones from other cultures (e.g., Russian *banya*, Turkish *hammam*, Jewish *shvitz*, Korean *jjimjilbang*) and ones that have proliferated due to new technologies (e.g., electric/infrared saunas). Practically speaking, saunas can vary in many notable ways:- Temperature- Relative humidity- Heating method- Duration of use- Frequency of use- Whether intervallic “cooling off” periods are employed and what they entail (e.g., cold plunge, rolling in snow, sitting in a cooler room)- Design and construction of the structure itself- Additional practices like the use of veniks (“bath brooms” made of birch) in Russian banya practice",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1594/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/874/edit,Sauna,What is the history of sauna?,"The history of sauna goes back thousands of years, and modern versions of sauna have certainly evolved since people in Finland first dug pits in the ground where they [heated stones on a wood fire and threw water on the hot rocks](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/30904_Chapter10.pdf) to create a heated space. Pronounced “SOW (rhymes with “wow”)-nah” by Finns or “SAW-nah” by most English speakers, the word “sauna” is perhaps [the only Finnish word that has entered the English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Finnish_origin); it refers to both the practice of sauna bathing and the physical structure where bathing takes place. As Finnish people migrated all over the world, they brought their sauna traditions to many different cultures, and Finnish sauna culture is [recognized by UNESCO](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/sauna-culture-in-finland-01596).",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1595/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/874/edit,Sauna,What is the traditional Finnish sauna practice?,"The traditional Finnish sauna is believed to cleanse and refresh the body and mind and is considered an [important cultural and spiritual ritual](https://www.finnleo.com/hubfs/assets/health-benefits-library/sauna-history-trivia/cyberbohemia.com-History-of-the-Finnish-Sauna-and-the-Nordic-Bath.pdf) (the old saying “*saunassa ollaan kuin kirkossa*” means “behave in sauna as you would in church”). Different regions and even different Finnish households may have slightly different sauna practices, but most homes, hotels, apartment complexes, student dorms, gyms, and public halls in Finland have sauna facilities that are used [daily or at least weekly](https://saunologia.fi/in-english/finnish-sauna-essentials-part-1). [After a quick shower to remove surface sweat and grime](https://visitjyvaskyla.fi/en/sauna/what-is-sauna/procedures-and-etiquette/), the Finnish sauna ritual begins with a dry phase, during which bathers get accustomed to the heat from the wood-fired or coal-fired stove topped with hot stones. Individual bathers can choose their level of heat by moving closer to or farther away from the stove, by sitting on the lower benches (cooler air) or higher benches (hotter air), or by placing a cold wet towel on the head or the back of the neck. In fact, many Finns wear hats in the sauna, which shields the head from the heat and increases overall comfort.In the next phase, water is thrown on the hot stones to create [*löyly*](https://finland.fi/life-society/bare-facts-of-the-sauna/), the heated steam atmosphere that surrounds the bathers and condenses on the skin along with the sweat from the dry heat phase. This “sweating from the inside and condensing from the outside” is considered a purifying ritual that cleanses and promotes good health. Many Finns also use a “bath broom” or small switch made of birch twigs, called a [*vihta*](https://www.scandinaviastandard.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-finnish-saunas/), to lightly swish or beat the skin to enhance the stimulating sensation and promote circulation, alongside washing with water, soap, and shampoo.  The cooling phase of sauna usually involves a cold plunge in water (a pool, lake, pond, or a hole in the ice in winter) or a roll in the snow outside, though a cold shower can also suffice. The hot/cold contrast is invigorating and is an important part of the traditional Finnish sauna experience. [The hot/cold phases can be alternated several times](https://saunainternational.net/sauna-how-to-take-a-sauna-bath/), according to personal taste.  After sauna, it is also common to have a small snack, like a [cool drink and a sandwich or sausage](https://visitjyvaskyla.fi/en/sauna/what-is-sauna/procedures-and-etiquette/), to rehydrate, refuel, and relax with body and mind cleansed and soothed.",

Exercise definitely increases respiratory rate, and sauna sometimes does the same. Additionally, they are similar in their long-term benefits, improving blood pressure, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness.[PMID: 15476570][reference|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572066/|title=Normal Versus Chronic Adaptations To Aerobic Exercise|published=2022|authors= Farrell & Turgeon]At the time of creation of this page, there are two studies that have directly compared exercise and sauna:A 2019 study in 19 healthy participants compared a 25-minute session in a traditional Finnish sauna at 93°±3°C and 13%–20% relative humidity to a 6-minute session on a stationary bicycle ergometer (starting at 50 watts and increasing by 10 W every minute to a maximum of 100 W).[PMID: 31126559] Interestingly, despite interventions with very different durations, the outcomes measured followed very similar trends and reached almost identical final values: systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by about 15 mmHg in both groups; heart rate increased by about 43 and 53 bpm in the exercise and sauna group, respectively; and the product of systolic blood pressure and heart rate (a correlate of cardiac oxygen consumption) increased by 107% — which was similar to the increase observed during exercise. Similar to exercise, blood pressure dropped below presauna levels within 30 minutes of the end of the sauna bath.A 2022 crossover study in 10 healthy women compared moderate-intensity exercise (heart rate between 55% and 70% of maximal heart rate) on a stationary bike, infrared sauna at 60°C (140℉) and less than 20% relative humidity, and resting at approximately 25°C (77℉) , with each intervention applied in three 15-minute intervals separated by 5 minutes of rest at 25°C  (77℉).[PMID: 34954348] This trial found that tympanic temperature (a proxy of core temperature) was significantly higher in the sauna group and that respiratory rate was significantly higher in the exercise group. Interestingly, heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, and transient arterial stiffness did not differ between the sauna and exercise groups. There are many reasons for these unremarkable findings, but it’s possible that neither intervention was sufficiently physiologically stressful to meaningfully distinguish it from the control condition.Overall, it seems that sauna *can* provoke cardiovascular responses that are similar to exercise, although the specifics of the sauna intervention matter a lot.  It’s also important to note that, unlike exercise, sauna does not actively engage skeletal muscles and therefore wouldn’t be expected to cause improvements in muscle mass, muscle strength, or muscle endurance unless paired with an exercise training program.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1598/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/874/edit,Sauna,What happens when sauna is paired with exercise?,"Exercise and sauna both benefit the cardiovascular system, and a few studies have shown them to be especially beneficial when combined. In a randomized controlled trial from 2022, people with low activity levels and at least one cardiovascular disease who did a 1-hour exercise regimen (comprising both resistance and aerobic training) followed by a 15-minute sauna session thrice weekly had considerably better improvements in VO~2~max, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol than people who only exercised.[PMID:35785965] Similarly, a study from 2015 found that although 5 days of sauna alone was sufficient to improve markers of cardiac function in people with heart failure, adding approximately 1 hour of exercise to the regimen improved these outcomes even more.[PMID: 25941983]Of course, these studies alone don’t tell us whether the sauna-exercise pairing is effective because they are synergistic (i.e., exercise potentiates the effects of sauna and vice-versa), or whether it’s simply because the participants in the combined treatments groups received two interventions instead of one. Regardless, both exercise and sauna seem to be similarly worthwhile strategies for managing cardiovascular disease.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1599/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/874/edit,Sauna,Why might sauna support longevity?,"The notion that sauna may support longevity is largely supported by a series of studies on a cohort of 2,315 middle-aged men in Finland, which found that sauna use was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality; people who used sauna the most (4–7 times per week for a duration of approximately 19 minutes or more per session) had a 50% reduction in risk for these outcomes.[PMID:25705824] A similar dose-dependent relationship was also present for sauna use and age-related neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, with the most frequent sauna bathers having a 65% reduced risk of these conditions.[PMID:27932366]Broadly speaking, it seems that sauna supports longevity in a similar way to exercise — by acting as a mild physiological stressor, it promotes cardiovascular, neurological, and immune function. In other words, it’s a hormetic stressor that promotes physiological responses that help bolster body systems that are most likely to falter during aging.More specifically, the hormetic effects of sauna are the result of its influence on the following:[PMID: 34363927]- **Heat shock protein expression:** Sauna (and heat generally) increases cellular concentrations of heat shock proteins, a broad class of proteins that regulate a number of cellular processes related to gene expression and cell division and also recycle and repair other proteins that are damaged. There’s mechanistic evidence that they may help prevent neurodegeneration and muscle atrophy, and some observational research in humans has correlated heat shock protein levels with small (approximately 1 year) increases in lifespan.[PMID:20388090]- **Nrf2 activity:** *Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor* (Nrf2) regulates antioxidant and immune functions in cells, and heat seems to increase its expression, at least in human skeletal muscle.[PMID:32765299]- **IL-6 and IL-10 activity:** Similarly, sauna (and exercise) increases circulating levels of *interleukin 6* and *interleukin 10* (IL-6 and IL-10, respectively). The former is associated with increased inflammation, but it also increases levels of the latter, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Given that low-grade inflammation is a defining characteristic of many chronic diseases, it’s possible that sauna’s effect on inflammatory signaling may lead to ultimately more favorable levels of inflammation in the body.",

A meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials on the effect of exercise interventions in people with Parkinson&#039;s disease also found significant improvements in measures of motor function for exercise interventions in people with Parkinson&#039;s, compared to non-exercising or recreational-activity-only control groups. However, there were no significant improvements in non-motor Parkinson’s symptoms.[PMID: 32963753] Overall, the growing body of research on exercise and Parkinson’s disease suggests that exercise may significantly slow disease progression, but more research is needed to better understand the type of exercise and intensity level that may be optimal in different individuals. Parkinson&#039;s disease also tends to present as different clinical subtypes in different individuals,[PMID: 26110797] and it isn’t currently clear which subtypes may benefit the most from exercise interventions. The overall positive body of evidence has prompted the creation of evidence-based fitness programs designed to improve physical function and delay[reference|url=https://www.ohiohealth.com/services/neuroscience/our-programs/delay-the-disease|title=Delay the Disease: The #1 Exercise Program That Fights Parkinson’s; Ohio, USA: OhioHealth, cited January 2023|] disease progression in people with Parkinson&#039;s.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1677/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/23/edit,Cardiovascular Health,What supplements (and foods) can improve cardiovascular health?,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the #1 cause of death globally. But a mix of the right foods and complementary supplements can help decrease your risk factors.February is [National Heart Month](https://healthfinder.gov/NHO/FebruaryToolkit.aspx). Although heart disease is the [leading cause of death for men and women worldwide](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/), it’s largely preventable. That makes heart-health supplements a big business, which means a lot of hype and marketing fluff by various supplement companies.So we’ve taken it upon ourselves to analyze five supplements that have _actual_ evidence behind their benefits. As always, remember to always consult with your physician before taking anything — some supplements have medication interactions.# Nitrates #[Nitrates] are one of the reasons why vegetables are so good for you. Nitr_ates_ break down into nitr_ites_, which circulate in the body and are turned into nitric oxide (NO). Nitrates, found abundantly in [beetroot] and a variety of leafy greens (arugula, collards, etc.), are a reliable and effective way to increase nitric oxide synthesis in the body. Elevated NO levels are associated with better circulation and lower blood pressure.[PMID:29141968]Eating a diet with a good amount of nitrate-containing vegetables decreases your risk for hypertension[PMID:29141968] and can improve endothelial cell function (the cells that line the inside of your blood vessels).[PMID:25764393] As an added bonus, increasing your overall vegetable (and fruit!) intake can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death.[PMID:28338764] Although you can find nitrates in processed meats, it’s not quite the same as getting them through vegetables. It is thought that various compounds in the meat interact with the nitrates during cooking and processing to form potentially pro-carcinogenic elements like nitrosamines. You can read up on this process and how it may affect your health here: [Scientists found that red meat causes cancer ... or did they?](https://examine.com/articles/scientists-just-found-that-red-meat-causes-cancer--or-did-they/)# Garlic #While [garlic] can also enhance NO signaling in the body, its blood pressure lowering effects are mostly due to another compound: [hydrogen sulfide](https://examine.com/supplements/garlic/#summary2-0) (H~2~S). Whether part of your diet or supplemented, garlic is a cheap and potent way to increase hydrogen sulfide signaling in the body — which in turn relaxes blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.[PMID:26764326]In those with elevated cholesterol (>200 mg/dL, >5.5 mmol/L), consistently consuming garlic for two months or more can moderately reduce total as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and can _slightly_ bump up high-density lipoprotein (HDL).[PMID:23590705] Because it can improve several cardiovascular parameters, garlic makes a good heart-health supplement.# Vitamin K2 #A healthy artery is a flexible one. During arterial calcification, calcium adheres to the artery wall, increasing its stiffness. Arterial stiffness and flexibility are very reliable biomarkers of mortality from cardiovascular diseases. [Vitamin K2](https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-k/), found in egg yolks and some fermented foods, is one of the few dietary supplements that may be able to reduce arterial calcification[PMID:24936265] and stiffness.[PMID:25694037] Vitamin K can roughly be broken up into 3 groups: K~1~, K~2~, and K~3~. K~1~ plays a large role in blood clotting, while K~2~ is responsible for calcium regulation. K~3~ is a synthetic provitamin not used in human food fortification or supplementation, as it can harm your health.[PMID:25057538]While most can get adequate K~1~ from eating green leafy vegetables, K~2~ supplementation may be necessary to reap some of K~2~ cardiovascular benefits.*Bonus:* Vitamin K2 provides benefits for bone health too![PMID:16801507] It’s especially useful if you take [vitamin D] and [calcium].# Berberine #Insulin resistance can worsen cardiovascular health over time, since chronically elevated blood sugars can cause tissue damage and increased blood pressure.[PMID:22240906][PMID:23882055] [Berberine] is an AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activator — which means it can help draw glucose and lipids into a cell, allowing them to be used as energy.With blood sugar reduction comparable to the diabetes drug [Metformin](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a696005.html), berberine is a very potent blood glucose-lowering agent that can be beneficial for people with impaired glucose regulation. When paired with lifestyle interventions, berberine can greatly improve glucose levels (HbA1c) and help bring down high cholesterol in those with type 2 diabetes.[PMID:25498346] # Taurine #[Taurine] (L-taurine) is a conditionally essential amino acid found abundantly in the body — particularly in heart tissues where it helps maintain a regular heartbeat.[PMID:20804594] Under healthy conditions, our bodies can produce taurine from the amino acids methionine and cysteine and from [vitamin B6](https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-b6/).In patients with heart failure, short-term taurine supplementation (~2 weeks) yielded improvements in cardiovascular function surrounding a bout of exercise.[PMID:28118062][PMID:28580833][PMID:21334852] Studies have also suggested that taurine may have some beneficial effects on blood pressure in those with pre-hypertension or hypertension.[PMID:26781281][PMID:12436205] # Better heart health through food and supplementation #> Adding more garlic, leafy greens, and beets to your diet is an easy first step to protect your heart and February is the perfect time to get started! > Remember — supplementation is complimentary to good nutrition, not a replacement for it (and make sure you’re getting high-quality sleep and a fair amount of exercise).

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1683/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1344/edit,Running Performance,What carb intake is ideal for running?,"If you’re a marathoner (or training to be one), you may have noticed that many popular supplements intended to improve your physical performance, fall flat when used during endurance events. Pre-workout supplements and stimulants, for example, don’t work because a marathon typically lasts longer than the stimulant itself, leaving you crashing mid race. Even [creatine], a supplement used to improve physical performance, is counterproductive because it results in temporary water weight gain, which makes running harder.Carbohydrate supplements however, are far more effective than traditional physical performance enhancers. Gel packs, or energy gels, are ideal for improving marathon performance because they are easy to ingest during a race.# Energy gel supplementation #So what makes gel packs so effective? Runners talk about eating a big bowl of pasta the night before a race because “carb-loading” is a good way to increase glycogen levels. A lot of glycogen is used in the first 10 minutes of exercise, and the rate of glycogen use falls until it is depleted altogether.*Have you ever ‘hit the wall’ during a marathon?* Glycogen depletion is responsible for that feeling. Eating a lot of carbohydrates the night before might delay the wall, but it won’t necessarily prevent it altogether. This is why energy gels are an ideal way to get mid-race carbohydrates. They are dense and viscous, which reduces the risk of intestinal upset, even during exercise. Plus, they’re light and portable, which means you can carry them with you or easily snag a few from an aid station. Just don’t forget to properly dispose of the wrapper!# The evidence #A recent study[PMID:24901444] investigated whether energy gel supplementation in the middle of a race can help delay or prevent hitting the wall during a marathon. Researchers split non-elite marathon runners into two groups. One group was provided energy gels containing 20 grams of carbohydrates and 30 milligrams of caffeine (equivalent to one cup of tea), and were told to eat two before the race, one when they believed they had hit the wall, and another every 20 minutes afterward. The runners in the second group were left to fend for themselves. Researchers also monitored the water intake of both groups.The results show that the energy gel group was able to maintain its speed throughout the marathon, while the control group began to drop off around the halfway point. Though both groups were running at about the same speed at the beginning of the marathon, researchers found significant differences at the last three checkpoints of the race, beginning at the 18 mile mark.The runners supplementing energy gels averaged a completion time of 3:38.31 while the control group had an average completion time of 3:49.26. Energy gel supplementation was found to improve time by just over 10 minutes, or by about 5%.# Preparing for the race #Runners having trouble with energy levels or anxious about hitting ‘the wall’ for the first time can consider energy gel supplementation to improve their time and avoid getting hit by a ton of bricks.Never try anything for the first time during a race. If energy gels sound right for you, try taking one or two during a long training run. You don’t want to find out gels disagree with you when you’re lining up at the starting line.[New to running?

Imaging tests such as ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) may be used to examine the urinary tract for the presence of stones.[PMID: 24908592][PMID: 25168527] X-ray imaging may also be used, but is more often used in follow-up care,[PMID:19694714] due to its more limited ability to detect smaller stones.[PMID: 12074804]",

If the stone is too large for removal or can’t be dislodged from its location, a stent may be placed in the ureter to encourage the stone to pass, or it may instead be broken into tiny pieces with a laser, sound waves, or electrical energy.[PMID: 32809391]*Percutaneous nephrolithotomy* (PCNL): PCNL is a surgical procedure that involves the insertion of an endoscope through a small incision in the skin into the kidney.

The high prevalence of kidney stones in the general population has created a strong demand for supplements with potential for prevention or treatment. Unfortunately, some supplement companies have marked products for this purpose with little to no evidence of efficacy on kidney stones. One paper published in 2020 surveyed the available supplements on two popular online supplement sellers, analyzing 27 products that contained 56 different ingredients. The product claims included dissolving kidney stones, preventing stone formation, and relieving symptoms of kidney stones. The authors noted that of the 56 ingredients assessed, only 9 had been studied in the context of kidney stones, and only 5 had any published evidence in support of their use.

Frequent water intake will make the urine more diluted, preventing the buildup of stone-forming substances.[PMID: 8583588] People who are prone to getting kidney stones should aim to drink more than 2 liters of water per day (more during the summer, to account for increased water loss through sweating).[PMID: 8583588][PMID:27188687]Note, however, that aggressive hydration, or drinking large volumes of water to “make a kidney stone pass faster,” is not supported by the evidence and will only make more urine, which will in turn cause more pain as the urine attempts to pass the kidney stone. Hydration is important in the *prevention* of kidney stones, but once someone has renal colic, overhydration does not help.[PMID:17094744] *Limit high-oxalate foods*: Since so many foods contain oxalate, a ‘low-oxalate diet’ may be difficult to achieve. Instead, foods that are high in oxalate should be limited. Some examples of foods with high oxalate content include spinach, beets, peanuts, chocolate, sweet potatoes, and wheat bran. In situations where high- oxalate foods can’t be avoided, there may be a benefit to consuming food high in calcium at the same time, which could limit oxalate absorption.[PMID: 24857648]*Consume calcium-rich foods*: This one is counterintuitive—since most kidney stones consist of calcium oxalate, it would seem that limiting calcium intake would be beneficial. However, calcium has the opposite effect. The binding of calcium ions to oxalate in the stomach and intestines rather than the kidneys makes it less likely for stones to form. When calcium binds to oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, the low-solubility calcium oxalate salt is mostly excreted in the stool. In contrast, low-calcium intake increases the absorption of oxalate molecules through the intestines and excretion via the urine. When oxalate levels increase in the urine, it is available to interact with calcium ions, where it forms calcium-oxalate kidney stones in the urinary tract.[PMID:9987084]*Reduce sodium intake*: Consuming extra sodium increases calcium leakage into the urine, promoting conditions for stone formation.[PMID:8326549] It’s unclear exactly what sodium intake is ideal, but reducing sodium intake reduces urinary calcium levels, in turn reducing kidney stone risk.[PMID:25031016]. A common recommendation is to aim for less than 2 g of sodium per day, which is equivalent to 5 g of table salt.[PMID: 27188687]*Avoid soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages*: Consuming one or more sugar-sweetened sodas per day was associated with a 23-33% increase in risk of kidney stone formation compared to less than one serving per week.[PMID:23676355] The connection between soda intake and kidney stones has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial, which found that habitual soda-drinkers had reduced risk of recurring kidney stones after eliminating their intake of all soft drinks.[PMID: 1624973]*Limit animal protein consumption*:  Consumption of animal proteins can increase the amount of stone-forming substances such as calcium and uric acid in the urine, which could promote stone formation in people who are prone to getting kidney stones.[PMID: 24518789] Current guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend that people who are prone to getting kidney stones should limit their intake of animal proteins.[PMID:24857648]",

BCCs usually occur on the face (e.g., nose, ears, and lip) and neck as well as other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., sunlight). Bleeding and scabbing is a common sign of BCC.- **Squamous cell carcinomas:** SCCs are typically pink to red-colored bumps. The affected skin can be scaly and appear inflamed. As with BCCs, SCCs most commonly occur on the face, neck, and other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation. SCCs are often preceded by red, scaly areas of skin known as actinic keratoses.- **Melanoma:** Melanomas are usually brown to black-colored lesions, resembling a mole, though they can also be pink papules. These lesions are generally asymmetrical, with irregularly-shaped, poorly-defined borders. Melanomas also tend to grow over time, often becoming larger than 6 mm in diameter (roughly the size of a pencil eraser). On the skin of chronically sun-exposed areas (e.g., the face), a melanoma subtype known as *lentigo maligna* may resemble a large sun spot (i.e., a flat patch of darker skin, also known as a liver spot, an age spot, or solar lentigo).",

While dehydration can contribute to symptoms of a hangover, it may not be the cause of hangovers per se — see below.Rather, hangover seems to be the result of the direct effects of alcohol (ethanol) on the production of *reactive oxygen species* (ROS) — which are generated during the breakdown of alcohol. ROS elicit mitochondria damage and oxidative stress throughout the body and *central nervous system* (CNS). ROS also activate the immune system, initiating both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the body and CNS. Symptoms such as [nausea], [vomiting], [headaches|headache], [confusion], tremor, and learning and [memory] deficits occur in the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, and higher levels of inflammation and ROS are associated with a greater hangover severity, directly implicating them in the pathology of hangover.[PMID:32630717]Other factors contributing to hangover include: an alteration in neurotransmitters such as [GABA], [glutamate], [dopamine], serotonin, and the endocannabinoids; disturbances in [sleep] quality or quantity due to alcohol consumption; and alterations in hormones and [electrolytes].[PMID:30916313]",

Hangover symptoms occur after a single bout of heavy drinking; alcohol withdrawal occurs when someone who regularly drinks alcohol suddenly stops drinking or begins to drink less. Regular alcohol consumption results in neurochemical changes: increased excitatory *N-methyl-D-aspartate* (NMDA) neuroreceptors and decreased responsiveness of the inhibitory *gamma-aminobutyric acid* ([GABA]) receptors in the brain. Without the regular dose of alcohol, NMDA receptors are excessively excited by glutamate and GABA receptors cannot adequately inhibit this excitation. This presents as [alcohol dependence symptoms|symptoms of alcohol withdrawal] — which include anxiety, confusion, exhaustion, headaches, irritability, shaking and tremors, and sleeplessness — and in the worst case, as hallucinations and seizures that can become severe enough to lead to death.[PMID:15053409]There are other major differences between alcohol withdrawal and hangover. Hangover symptoms typically begin within hours of drinking cessation (when BAC reaches zero) and can resolve within 24 hours. In contrast, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can begin several hours to days after someone stops drinking, and symptoms can last for a week or longer, though they’re typically at their worst around days 2–3.[PMID:15053409]In summary, while anyone can experience an alcohol hangover, only individuals who have developed a tolerance for alcohol can experience alcohol withdrawal and the associated symptoms.",

Some studies suggest that alcohols with more congeners (i.e., brandy, red wine, rum, bourbon) may lead to worse hangovers than those with the least congener content (i.e., vodka, beer, gin, white wine), but not all evidence suggests that this is true.[PMID:18182417]",

Interestingly, there is very little evidence that [electrolytes|electrolyte] imbalances contribute to or are associated with hangovers.[PMID: 10836917][PMID: 4460229]The lack of a direct causal role of dehydration in hangover is evidenced by the fact that hydration is insufficient to completely resolve hangover symptoms. It should be noted that few studies have investigated the effects of hydration and/or electrolyte supplementation on hangover symptoms.

After HF is diagnosed, it is then further classified based on severity and type. The two main types, which often have different causes, are: *HF with reduced ejection fraction* (HFrEF), in which the heart can’t squeeze with enough force to push out all the blood, and *HF with preserved ejection fraction* (HFpEF), in which the heart can’t fully relax to be filled with enough blood to supply the body.[PMID:28613623][PMID:35363499]",

The additional energy demand of lactation is estimated at about 450 to 500 kcals per day (see below). Lactating people also have an increased requirement for protein, choline, many vitamins (including A, C, E, and most B vitamins), and the minerals iodine, selenium, and zinc.[PMID:15883453][PMID:25274837] However, if a parent’s diet is deficient in the nutrients required to make milk, their body will mobilize and (if necessary) deplete fat, vitamin, and mineral stores to meet the demands of lactation, even at the expense of the parent’s health.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1755/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1246/edit,Lactation,Which other factors can affect lactation?,"The primary driver of lactation past 10 days postpartum is milk removal. If the breasts aren’t emptied (i.e., the stored milk is removed to the point that the breasts feel soft and/or hand-expressing more is difficult) at feedings, the body makes less milk to compensate. Optimizing breastfeeding techniques is therefore important for sustained and bountiful milk production (see below).Stress/anxiety, medications (e.g., oral birth control), menstruation, fatigue, hormonal conditions, genetics, and breast surgery can also affect lactation.[reference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275934454_Clinical_Update_and_Treatment_of_Lactation_Insufficiency|title=Clinical Update and Treatment of Lactation Insufficiency|authors=Sultana, A. et al|journal=Medical Journal of Islamic World Academy of Sciences|published=2013] Many prescription and over-the-counter medications and recreational drugs, including alcohol, can be expressed in human milk, but not all of them are expressed at levels that could be harmful to the breastfeeding infant.[reference|url=https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/medications-quick-guide-parents/|title=Medications - A Quick Guide for Parents: La Leche League International, cited November 3, 2022][reference|url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Medications_and_Mothers_Milk_2017/jiaTDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7|title=Medications and Mother’s Milk|authors=Thomas W.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1756/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1246/edit,Lactation,How is milk produced?,"During pregnancy, a rise in hormones such as progesterone and prolactin stimulates the growth of breast tissue, and the breasts increase by an average of one to two cup sizes. This outward growth is one indicator that the breasts are undergoing the inward growth necessary to support lactation, including the transition of mammary glands (modified sweat glands) into secretory cells, extensive branching of the milk ducts, and enlargement of the Montgomery glands (sebaceous glands in the areola surrounding the nipple).[PMID:27354238] By 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy, the breasts are fully ready to make milk. This marks the first stage of lactation: **lactogenesis I**. The end result is the formation of colostrum (“first milk”), the secretion and production of which is held in check by high levels of circulating progesterone.[PMID:11236732] Colostrum is rich in immunological components (especially the antibody [immunoglobulin A]) and developmental factors (like [epidermal growth factor]). It serves as the infant’s food for the first few days of life.[PMID:18027076] It also has a laxative effect in infants, helping the newborn expel meconium (the first stool).     After childbirth and expulsion of the placenta, progesterone drops and prolactin rises, cueing the second stage of milk production: **lactogenesis II**. This stage is known for copious milk production and begins by the fourth day postpartum with the production of around 500 mL of breast milk (called transitional milk). If lactogenesis II does not occur by four days postpartum, it is considered “delayed”. Approximately 20% to 30% of lactating parents have delayed lactogenesis II, and although the causes vary (e.g., obesity, primiparous parent/first-time parent, stress during delivery), the experience alone is associated with cessation of breastfeeding by four weeks postpartum.[PMID:22575242] Appropriate clinical support of these parents is necessary. The milk produced during lactogenesis II is different from colostrum. It contains less sodium and chloride and more lactose as the closing of tight junctions in the mammary epithelial cells alters what passes into the milk.[PMID:11236732] While the milk production is still under endocrine control, frequent breastfeeding is important if the parent intends to continue breastfeeding. At around ten days postpartum, there is a switch from endocrine control to autocrine (or local) control of milk production. This ushers in the maintenance stage: **lactogenesis III**. During lactogenesis III, the primary driver for increased milk supply is increased demand via milk removal. The breasts will make milk indefinitely as long as the milk is removed and there are no underlying lactation issues. (This explains how wet nurses maintained their occupation in lieu of repeated personal pregnancies.) Consequently, the role of systemic hormones in milk production and infant feeding is much smaller but not absent. For example, the hormone oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary gland and is involved in the milk letdown reflex, and the hormone prolactin is released from the anterior pituitary gland and is involved in milk production. Stimulation of the nerve endings in the nipple by infant suckling or breast pumps is what triggers the release of these two hormones. [PMID:27354238] By the end of the first month, the milk is considered fully mature and offers the infant approximately 0.9 to 1.2 grams of protein/dL, 3.2 to 3.6 grams of fat/dL, and 6.7 to 7.8 grams of lactose/dL.[PMID:23178060] The exact macronutrient ratio does vary, especially when comparing milk from mothers of preterm infants to milk from mothers of term infants, and it also changes with time.[PMID:23178060] When the mother begins to wean her infant and the local signals for milk production decrease, involution begins. Involution is the process by which the milk-producing cells are removed through apoptosis (programmed cell death) and replaced with fat cells. It may take up to 12 months for all lactating cells to be replaced.[PMID:18027076]",

Keep in mind that this recommendation, despite being a good general rule, overestimates or underestimates the true metabolic requirements in about one-third of lactating parents.[PMID:31577639] Determining the exact caloric requirements for each lactating parent simply isn’t feasible because it would necessitate careful calculations of the amount of milk produced, the energy density of the milk, and the energetic efficiency of milk synthesis, all of which are generally out of reach for the average parent.

A number of complex mechanisms orchestrate this localized ebb and flow of milk, but one key player is a whey protein in breast milk called *feedback inhibitor of lactation* (FIL). If the milk is not removed, the build-up of FIL in the breast triggers a negative feedback loop, inhibiting additional milk production.

In contrast, the decline in systolic blood pressure from baseline was significantly greater for the non-fried potato group vs. usual diet, but this was a secondary outcome. The decline in blood pressure did not reach statistical significance on the diet with fried potatoes or potassium supplements.An additional small trial reports that eating eight small purple potatoes per day for four weeks reduces blood pressure in people with high blood pressure (hypertension), but the finding should be interpreted with caution due to major methodological weaknesses.[PMID:22224463] For example, the paper doesn’t statistically compare blood pressure in the intervention group against the control group, which is the most important comparison in a controlled trial. Together, these two randomized controlled trials provide modest evidence that eating non-fried potatoes can lower blood pressure, consistent with the high potassium content of spuds.In a study testing the satiety (fullness after a meal) effects of 32 commonly-eaten foods, boiled potatoes were the most sating per calorie, beating other high-satiety foods like fish, steak, fruit, and oatmeal.[PMID:7498104] Baked potatoes are expected to be comparable due to their similar composition and palatability. This suggests that potatoes may be helpful for controlling calorie intake and body weight, although this hasn’t been directly tested. It’s also important to note that this study used plain potatoes, and the effects would likely be different with added butter, cheese or other calorie-dense toppings.Potatoes are unusually nutritionally complete. Although a potato-only diet lacks significant quantities of vitamins A, E, and B12, most other essential nutrients are present at adequate or near-adequate levels. Small experiments in the early 20th century reported that people can eat almost nothing but potatoes for 5.5 to 10 months with no apparent ill effects.[reference|https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)86731-X][PMID:16744005]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1800/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/50/edit,Potatoes,What are the main drawbacks of potatoes?,"Most types of potatoes, such as the common russet, have a high glycemic index. This means they increase blood glucose more than most other foods containing the same amount of carbohydrate. However, this varies by potato type and processing method. For example, frying potatoes, or cooling them after cooking, tends to lower their glycemic index.[PMID:18835944] Potatoes also have a high insulin index, meaning they increase insulin secretion more than most other foods.[PMID:9356547] The health implications of this aren’t entirely clear. Observational studies report no consistent association between the habitual glycemic index of the diet and body mass index, a measure of body fatness. Similarly, randomized controlled trials report no consistent effect of glycemic index on body weight.[PMID:34352885] In contrast, observational studies report that diets higher in glycemic index tend to be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes,[PMID:24265366][PMID:24787496] and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in women but not men.[PMID:23284926][PMID:22440121][PMID:23316283] In addition, people with diabetes may have a harder time controlling their blood sugar levels when they eat high-glycemic foods.[PMID:31374573] When considering potatoes specifically, there is no consistent association between the intake of boiled, baked, or mashed potatoes and cardiovascular risk in observational studies, but they are correlated with a slightly higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Intake of fried potatoes is more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in these studies, despite the lower glycemic index of fried potatoes.[PMID:29987352][PMID:26681722]Potatoes contain oxalates, which can contribute to the formation of kidney stones in susceptible people.[PMID:24393738][PMID:30566003] Potatoes also contain the toxic glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine, which can cause digestive distress and in very rare cases can be fatal. These are only present in potentially dangerous amounts in potatoes that are green, damaged, diseased, and potato sprouts. Peeling potatoes removes most of their glycoalkaloid content.[PMID:17090106]Per calorie, potatoes are not as dense in vitamins and minerals as low-calorie vegetables like greens, broccoli, and carrots. This isn’t necessarily a problem if potatoes are eaten as a starch alongside vegetables, as one would eat rice or bread. But if they’re viewed as a vegetable and eaten instead of low-calorie vegetables, they may lead to a lower intake of vitamins and minerals and a higher calorie intake.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1801/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/50/edit,Potatoes,How does preparation method impact the healthfulness of potatoes?,"Potatoes are commonly eaten baked, boiled, mashed, and fried. Relative to the other three preparation methods, frying results in a lower glycemic index, higher calorie density, greater  palatability, and lower satiety per calorie.[PMID:18835944][PMID:7498104] This is likely to increase calorie intake and contribute to weight gain. Consistent with this, an observational study reported that people who increase their intake of French fries and potato chips experienced much more weight gain than people who increased their intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes.[PMID:21696306] This must be interpreted with some caution due to the possibility of confounding by other diet and lifestyle factors. Adding calorie-dense toppings or ingredients like butter and cheese to baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes is expected to make them less filling per calorie.Cooling potatoes after cooking tends to reduce their glycemic index and insulin index, even if they are subsequently reheated, although this is not always the case.[PMID:31484331][PMID:15800557] To the extent that dietary glycemic index and insulin index may impact health, cooling potatoes prior to eating may make them healthier.High-temperature cooking of some foods creates a carcinogen called acrylamide, and fried potatoes are one of the largest dietary exposures to this compound.[PMID:31866690] Although dietary acrylamide is a theoretical concern, observational studies have not reported consistent links between dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of cancer at any site, with the possible exception of kidney cancer.[PMID:25403648] Soaking potatoes prior to frying reduces the formation of acrylamide.",

When exposed to light, potatoes produce higher levels of toxic glycoalkaloids in the skin and just below it. Although glycoalkaloids are not visible, the potato’s skin also turns green when exposed to light, and the green color is visible.- Storing potatoes in a cool place is not necessary but it prolongs their storage life.- Storing potatoes in the refrigerator (less than 40 degrees F) for a week or more causes them to sweeten, which some people may not like.

Potatoes can cause digestive distress, especially if they are green, damaged, or sprouting, but there is scant evidence that they cause inflammation or joint pain.One randomized controlled trial tested the impact of potatoes on markers of inflammation, reporting that a single meal of potatoes led to higher circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokine [interleukin-6] in lean women but not women with obesity, and higher circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokine *[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]* (TNF-⍺) in women with obesity but not lean women, relative to All-Bran cereal in the six hours following the meal.[PMID:19186329] This result should be viewed with caution since the study reports many outcomes without statistically correcting for multiple comparisons, increasing the probability that some of the findings are due to chance. It is also not clear how potatoes would have fared if they had been compared to other types of food. A 4-week randomized controlled trial, meanwhile, found potatoes and refined grains did not clearly differ in their effect on the inflammatory marker *[C-reactive protein*] (CRP).Randomized controlled trials tend to suggest that eating tomatoes or tomato extracts, another food in the nightshade family, reduce markers of inflammation, although not all findings have been consistent.[PMID:23069270][PMID:22331646][PMID:30836363][PMID:16569044][PMID:17716544] Nightshades, including potatoes, contain glycoalkaloids, which can cause digestive distress.

Other common symptoms of a focal seizure include one-sided, uncontrollable bodily movements (e.g. twitching and jerking), loss of consciousness, and confusion. Generalized seizure symptoms can vary greatly: from brief lapses in consciousness only, to loss of consciousness in addition to stiffening of muscles and uncontrollable muscle contractions on both sides of the body.

Some old sources suggests that it could potentially help curb the appetite, but for the longest time it was uncertain whether this was because it had actual appetite suppressing properties or whether the taste experience just made people be more satisfied with less food.It was only due to some exploratory studies looking at what was inside the fruit that it became a popular supplement.## As a supplement ##Within _garcinia cambogia_ is a molecule, (-)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA for all intents and purposes), that is related to the taste of the fruit. The fame of this fruit as a fat loss agent skyrocketed in the 70s when a study[PMID:4815800] in rats found that it reduced food intake by as much as 17% and weight gain by as much as 36%.

Generally, exercises can be classed as *dynamic* or *static*. Dynamic exercises can be divided into *isotonic* movements and *isokinetic* movements. Isotonic movements are where the joints and muscles move through their range of motion under a constant resistance, while isokinetic exercise requires a machine to keep the body moving at a constant speed regardless of the resistance applied. Static exercise is frequently described as *isometric*, meaning that the body holds the same position against a fixed resistance to  perform exercises such as planks or wall sits.[PMID:9624661][PMID:32096113] For dynamic exercises, muscular endurance is best developed by high repetitions at submaximal resistance: for example, high reps of a squat at 50% of a *1-repetition maximum* (1RM) load. For static exercises, time-based training is the best way to develop endurance: for example, long-duration wall sits.Dynamic exercise is commonly recommended due to its similarity to everyday activities, and isotonic dynamic exercise, such as weightlifting, is the most practical option for the average person. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends isotonic resistance training at a low-to-moderate intensity, or at less than 50% of a 1RM weight, for two sets of 15–25 repetitions performed 2–3 times per week to improve muscular endurance.[PMID:21694556]",

When a person with an allergy is exposed to certain tree nuts, their immune system launches an “attack” against the proteins in the tree nut and can even create antibodies (specifically [immunoglobulin E] or IgE) that target the nut proteins. This response provokes the rapid development of allergic symptoms, which can affect a variety of body systems and may be mild, moderate, or severe and life-threatening. There are many different kinds of tree nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts and walnuts. An allergy to one tree nut does not guarantee an allergy to another, but it is common for people to react to more than one tree nut.

Reactions may include skin involvement (e.g., rashes, swelling, itching); eye discomfort (e.g., itchy, watery, and/or swollen eyes); respiratory difficulties (e.g., shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, throat swelling, hoarseness); gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea); cardiovascular changes (e.g., drops in blood pressure, increased heart rate); and neurological responses, although rare (e.g., fainting, seizures, dizziness).Most signs and symptoms occur within minutes of exposure to tree nuts, although a delayed response of up to 2 hours is possible. Exposure to tree nuts usually happens through ingestion — skin contact or inhalation rarely causes an allergic reaction.

An allergist will use this history in conjunction with a physical exam to guide the choice of additional diagnostic tests. The skin prick test is the most common diagnostic test and involves introducing the allergen into the skin through a small prick with a special tool. If IgE antibodies to tree nuts are present, the area that was pricked will swell. A swollen area 3 mm or greater in size is usually considered positive for an allergy, although some clinicians prefer an 8 mm or greater standard to decrease the chance of a false positive.[PMID:24734868] Blood tests that detect food-specific IgE antibodies may also be used to aid in the diagnosis. Although these diagnostic tests are helpful, they do not predict the severity of a person’s allergic reaction, nor are they useful in people without a history of allergic signs and symptoms (given the frequency of false positives). In some cases, an oral food challenge, which consists of gradual consumption of the allergen under direct medical supervision, may be recommended to confirm the allergy.[PMID:33510829][PMID:21134576] Ideally, allergy testing is done yearly because some allergies change or resolve over time.",

People with tree nut allergies need to carefully plan their diets to avoid eating certain tree nuts. This means also avoiding foods that contain or may be contaminated with tree nuts, such as food products made in facilities that use nuts in other products, which is a potential source of cross-contamination. Most countries require that food labels clearly state whether a food contains tree nuts, and many labels voluntarily state whether cross-contamination is possible, so checking the label on all packaged food items is important for people with allergies. Diet may even play a role in allergy prevention. Early introduction of allergenic foods (by approximately 6 months of age) alongside continued consumption reduces the risk of developing food allergies.[PMID:33250376][PMID:30886111][PMID:31781878]",

Normally, the immune system targets and attacks pathogens like viruses and bacteria but in the case of food allergies, the immune system identifies a certain food as an “invader” and launches an immune response against it. This breakdown of immune tolerance is primarily driven by *T helper 2* cells and often includes the production of food-specific IgE antibodies, all of which lead to a cascade of immune responses (like the activation of mast cells and release of cytokines) that cause allergic symptoms. Why the immune system reacts abnormally to certain foods in some people is not fully understood.[PMID:29300005]",

Food is the leading cause of anaphylaxis,[PMID:22244239] and anyone with an IgE-mediated food allergy can have an anaphylactic reaction. Common signs and symptoms include gastrointestinal manifestations (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea), skin reactions (e.g., itching, flushing), respiratory changes (e.g., nasal congestion, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, sense of choking), and cardiovascular complications (e.g., hypotension, cardiovascular collapse).[PMID:31466687][PMID:32880997]  Initial symptoms usually appear within minutes following exposure to the allergen, but it is not always immediately obvious that anaphylaxis is occurring because symptoms can evolve over time. Moreover, the severity of a previous reaction does not predict the severity of future reactions. As such, if anaphylaxis is suspected, it is recommended to administer intramuscular epinephrine as quickly as possible and seek emergency medical care because symptoms can come back (called biphasic anaphylaxis).[PMID:33476673] All people who have experienced or are at risk for anaphylaxis should have access to self-injectable epinephrine at all times.[PMID:21134576]",

When administered promptly, it is lifesaving. Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels (thereby preventing cardiovascular collapse), prevents or decreases swelling of the airways and promotes dilation of the airways (allowing air to better flow to and from the lungs), decreases the activity of mast cells and basophils (both of which release mediators that cause inflammation), and helps the heart beat more effectively (promoting blood flow).[PMID:28193791] Adverse effects include anxiety, restlessness, palpitations, headache, dizziness, pallor, and tremor.[PMID:15131564] Serious adverse effects, like dangerous heart arrhythmias, are rare.[PMID:14656845]Although epinephrine rapidly treats most of the dangerous symptoms of anaphylaxis, it is not a “cure” for allergic reactions or a replacement for immediately seeking medical help. Instead, epinephrine auto-injectors are a way to prevent serious complications from occurring before being seen by a clinician for additional evaluation and care. In some cases, additional medications may be needed to fully treat someone’s symptoms, or the allergic symptoms may return even after they initially resolved.

Immunotherapy involves exposing the allergic person to small amounts of the allergen in a medically supervised setting and gradually increasing the exposure dose over several months until the person reaches and no longer reacts to their “maintenance dose” (which is an individualized goal). The allergen is usually introduced through the mouth (e.g., oral immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy), but it can also be introduced through the skin (e.g., epicutaneous immunotherapy, subcutaneous immunotherapy).

However, significant publication bias was noted, mostly due to participants deviating from their assigned interventions or issues with the randomization process.[PMID: 36013514] Furthermore, when men were separated into groups with testosterone levels of more than 300 ng/dL and less than 300 ng/dL (hypogonadal men), a significant effect was only observed in the hypogonadal group (average effect of 1.9 versus a nonsignificant effect of 0.8 in the normal testosterone group).Due to the variety of dosages used, it might be useful to look at the results of individual studies:- 200 mg/day for 6 months increased total testosterone from 278 to 400 ng/dL. - 100 mg/day for 12 weeks increased total testosterone from 187 to 203 ng/dL.- 200 mg/day for 12 weeks (same study as above) increased total testosterone from 200 to 225 ng/dL.- 600 mg/day for 2 weeks increased total testosterone from 871 to 969 ng/dL.- Studies using 600 mg/day for 2 weeks, 200 mg/day for 6 months, 600 mg/day for 8 weeks, and 300 mg/day for 12 weeks noted no difference between tongkat ali and placebo.Overall, it seems that tongkat ali is just increasing testosterone levels in men with low testosterone, while it doesn’t seem to benefit men with normal or higher testosterone levels as often. It should also be noted that a majority of studies related to the effect of tongkat ali on testosterone were funded by Biotropics Malaysia Berhad, a pharmaceutical company who makes and sells Physta, the tongkat ali supplement used as the intervention, and several of the study investigators are also employees of the company.",

During a DGS test, participants are asked to repeat a series of random digits, either in the same order that they were revealed, or backwards.  *Simple and choice reaction time (simple/choice RT) tests* assess cognitive processing speed, which is well-correlated with attention and alertness. RT tests consist of two parts. For the first part (simple RT), participants are timed responding to a predictable stimulus. The second part of the test (choice RT) requires participants to respond in a correct way to one of several different, unanticipated stimuli.[PMID:33095365]The *Stroop color and word test* measures the Stroop effect, which is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli, such as color-words printed in like vs. different colors.[PMID:28446889] For example, the word blue, printed in red ink, is an incongruent stimulus that takes longer to cognitively process compared to the word blue, printed in blue ink (congruent stimulus). The delay in reaction time is partially a function of attention and focus.The *emotional Stroop test* (E-Stroop) is a variant of the color and word test that instead presents to participants either neutral words, or words that are related to particular emotional states or disorders. The latter, emotion-associated words tend to be named more slowly by participants, with the delay reflecting attention ability.[PMID:27405091][PMID:8711015]",

In 2011, Masicampo and Baumeister performed a series of experiments that suggested lack of planning, rather than lack of task completion per se, is the source of the intrusive, pinging reminders associated with the Zeigarnik effect. For one study, Masicampo and Baumeister asked college students to think about how they were going to prepare for a pending exam. Half of the participants were asked to make clear study plans, detailing the time, place, and location that they were going to study. The other half of the participants, the control group, did not make any specific plans. None of the participants actually studied — instead they were asked to perform some unrelated tasks. Compared to the control group, the planning group had much higher levels of focus and attention while performing their tasks, while the control group struggled with focus and attention.[PMID:21688924] Based on these observations, the researchers proposed that coming up with a specific plan relieves the subconscious mind of the requirement for incessant pings or reminders to the conscious mind about unresolved tasks.[PMID:21688924] This suggests that forming a plan to complete an  unresolved task in the future may be sufficient to overcome the Zeigarnik effect, relieving the associated drag on focus and attention.[PMID:36212194]",

This may increase the risk of having a small for gestational age or low birth weight infant.[PMID:36924660] However, some studies find that these risks are only present when maternal weight loss is significant, and there is no “catch up” weight gain later in pregnancy. In other words, if prepregnancy weight is normal, and weight loss in the first trimester is attenuated by regaining weight throughout the latter part of pregnancy, there is no significantly increased risk of fetal growth restriction.[PMID:35279131][PMID:16449113]There are few studies investigating the long-term risks of hyperemesis gravidarum to the infant, and the studies that do exist are of low quality. It is possible that children born to parents with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of developing anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, [testicular cancer], and neurodevelopmental disorders, like [autism spectrum disorder] and [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder], but the data is not robust or consistent enough to make strong conclusions about long-term risks.[PMID:35367190]",

Common thought patterns include intense fear of weight gain, an obsessive and distorted view of body weight or shape, and denial of illness or health risk. Common behaviors include refusing to eat around others, purging meals (vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, and severely restricting food intake. The physical manifestations of anorexia nervosa are similar to those of prolonged starvation and include being underweight, sensitivity to cold temperature, dry mouth, constipation, edema (swelling) in the extremities, and mental fatigue. Over time, people with anorexia can develop lanugo, a thin coat of fine body hair that is thought to help insulate the body. Anorexia can also lead to serious complications such as [cardiomyopathy], hypotension, bradycardia, [osteoporosis], muscle wasting, low white blood cell and platelet counts, electrolyte-induced arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), kidney damage, brain atrophy, and seizures.[reference|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000362.htm|Title=Anorexia: MedlinePlus; Bethesda, MD: National Library of Medicine US, cited May 1, 2023|published=April 30,2022][PMID:29083743]",

The primary goal of initial treatment is to improve caloric intake to avoid the associated medical conditions related to undernourishment. People who are affected may need to work with a medical doctor, a mental health professional, and a dietitian to safely increase their food intake and avoid refeeding syndrome (a life-threatening change in [electrolyte] concentrations). Some extremely malnourished people with serious complications may require hospitalization.Although some medications, like antidepressants and mood stabilizers, can be prescribed to address the underlying depression and anxiety, they don’t reduce the desire to lose weight or the harmful behaviors. Therefore, therapy with a professional trained in eating disorders is necessary to address the fears and beliefs that lead to disordered behaviors.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2057/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1067/edit,Multiple Sclerosis,What is the connection between Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis?,"*Epstein-Barr virus* (EBV) is an incredibly prevalent virus that infects over 90% of people globally. It is most commonly known for causing infectious mononucleosis, also called “mono”.[PMID:35931816] Research has found mounting evidence of a connection between EBV and MS, most notably some that suggests EBV may be an important trigger for MS onset. A 20-year epidemiological study of over 10 million U.S. military personnel found that EBV infection was associated with a 32-fold increased risk of developing MS.[PMID:35025605] Using multiple blood samples drawn both before disease onset and afterward, the researchers found that early markers of MS disease activity consistently began after EBV exposure, but not before. Out of the entire cohort, 955 people were diagnosed with MS and only 1 person did not demonstrate a history of EBV infection (indicated by a lack of EBV-specific antibodies in the blood). This is in line with previous research finding that over 99% of people with MS had EBV-specific antibodies.[PMID:16502434]   Further supporting the link between EBV and MS is the finding of several cross-reactive antibodies that attack both EBV proteins — most notably *EBV nuclear antigens* (EBNA) — and central nervous system proteins involved in MS.[PMID:35931816][PMID:35073561][PMID:18663124] This is a phenomenon called molecular mimicry, which is when a molecule from a foreign invader (in this case, EBV) looks very similar to a molecule in the human body and therefore antibodies generated against the virus may also inappropriately attack human tissues. These EBNA-specific antibodies have been found to be elevated in people with MS compared to people without the disease and are associated with an increased risk of MS development.[PMID:15914750] So, why is MS so uncommon when EBV is so prevalent? This likely depends heavily on genetics, particularly variations in the gene HLA-DRB1.[PMID:35931816] This gene controls how viral proteins are presented to the immune system upon infection, which may promote the generation of cross-reactive antibodies, meaning that many people who are infected with EBV won’t necessarily generate them. There is also evidence that other genetic variants that affect how the immune system responds to EBV may play a role.[PMID:31039804]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2058/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/14/edit,Healthy Aging & Longevity,What are “biological clocks” and how are they used to measure healthy aging and longevity?,"People age at a similar *chronological* rate, but differ in their physical and cognitive rates of aging. The decline in functional capacity that can be separated from chronological age is known as *biological* age, and is influenced by the interaction of our genes and environment.What’s responsible for these divergent aging trajectories? One theory, known as the epigenetic theory of aging, posits that aging is an unintended consequence of our biological development and maintenance programs, which give rise to distinct cellular changes or “molecular footprints.”[PMID: 29643443] One of the most prominent age-related processes is known as *DNA methylation* (DNAm). DNAm involves the addition of a methyl (CH~3~) group to DNA at a location called a CpG site. DNAm causes changes in gene transcription and gene expression. “Biological clocks” (also known as epigenetic clocks) precisely measure the levels of DNAm across various cells, tissues, and organs. Because they have been trained and tested on large datasets, biological clocks can not only accurately predict chronological age, but also biological age and other outcomes of interest, including the risk for age-related diseases, cancer, and all-cause mortality.[PMID: 29676998][PMID: 27077113][PMID: 27690265] In many instances, epigenetic age predicts morbidity and mortality outcomes better than chronological age or traditional risk factors.Perhaps the biggest value of biological clocks is not in their ability to correctly predict someone’s chronological age, but in what they can inform us about healthy biological aging. The discrepancy between a person’s biological age, as measured using epigenetic clocks, and their chronological age captures whether they’re aging faster or slower than normal. This is known as “age acceleration.” Someone with an epigenetic age older than their chronological age is said to have a positive age acceleration, while someone whose epigenetic age is younger than their chronological age has a negative age acceleration; the latter is desirable.![](https://examine.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/platform/2023/07/967254ce902bf3eb5a149dc8dd28c4eae3ae9a69.png)Epigenetic age and age acceleration can help predict a person’s lifetime health risks, such as their risk of developing certain cancers or their probability of becoming a centenarian (i.e., living to be 100 years old). Relatedly, certain diseases are associated with increased epigenetic age and positive age acceleration, like [Down syndrome] and [Parkinson’s disease].[PMID: 29643443] Furthermore, biological clocks are sensitive to lifestyle interventions. For example, the intake of fish, fruit, and vegetables is associated with negative age acceleration, while high levels of inflammation, blood glucose, blood pressure, and obesity are linked to positive age acceleration.[PMID: 32845048] This makes biological clocks attractive tools for assessing the effects of healthy lifestyle interventions in randomized controlled trials.While numerous clocks have been developed, some of the major commonly used ones include the Horvath age acceleration clock, the Hannum age acceleration clock, Levine’s “PhenoAge” clock, Lu’s “GrimAge” clock, Weidner’s age clock, and Zhang’s mortality clock.[PMID:32845048]While the area of biological clocks is not without controversy, the field is rapidly evolving.

However, chronic low back pain in many cases is “nonspecific”, meaning that the cause is not known. The typical treatment for nonspecific chronic low back pain typically begins with a primary care physician, who may ultimately recommend *nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs* (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen to manage pain.[PMID: 19530637] However, non-drug treatments — such as education, physical/exercise therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy —  are generally sought out as a first line of therapy.[PMID: 28192789] It is recommended that people with chronic low back pain should avoid strict bed rest and continue to stay active.[PMID:29573872] Severe pain may be treated with opioid pain medications *when necessary*.[PMID: 19530637] Additional treatments include tricyclic antidepressants, which may be used alongside analgesic (pain-relieving) therapy,[PMID: 14624092] or the drug gabapentin, which is used to treat pain, numbness, or tingling that can arise from nerve root damage or irritation.[PMID: 17909209] People with chronic low back pain are often referred to a physical therapist for treatment. Physical therapy involves exercises to correct muscle imbalances, postural deficiencies, or impaired mobility, possibly alongside soft tissue mobilization and/or spinal traction. Education about the nature of low back pain, addressing any fears surrounding low back pain, and exercises that gradually increase physical function and independence may all be included.[PMID:29573872] People with more severe pain and disability may be referred to a specialist for evaluation for surgery or epidural steroid injections.

A basic assessment of the menstrual cycle starts with measurements of frequency (menstruation or bleeding occurs every 24 to 38 days), regularity (the number of days between menstruation is similar each month), duration (bleeding does not last longer than eight days), and volume (loss of no more than 80 mL of menstrual blood per cycle).[PMID:22065325] The phases of the menstrual cycle are sometimes measured via basal body temperature and hormone levels in saliva, urine, or blood.[PMID:33113391] If there are abnormalities, like infrequent menstruation (oligomenorrhea), too frequent menstruation (polymenorrhea), the total absence of menstruation (amenorrhea), or very heavy bleeding (menorrhagia), a clinician can perform additional assessments to better understand the underlying cause of the abnormality. These additional assessments may include bloodwork and imaging. Blood tests can detect the levels of different hormones that affect the menstrual cycle (e.g., progesterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, androgens, prolactin). They can also measure iron levels, which are sometimes affected by menstrual bleeding, and may aid in the diagnosis of underlying bleeding disorders or infections. In some cases, imaging of the reproductive system is also necessary, usually beginning with an ultrasound. Serial transvaginal ultrasounds can visualize the changes that occur in the ovaries and endometrial lining throughout the menstrual cycle.[PMID:29313033]",

It may be a sign of *relative energy deficiency in sport* (RED-S), a condition indicating that the body does not have enough energy to meet its demands.[PMID:32139174] The consequences of RED-S are far-reaching, serious, and potentially irreparable.[PMID:32557402][PMID:34077990]",

For example, vitamin D deficiency is associated with dysmenorrhea and abnormal menstrual bleeding patterns, in which case supplementing with vitamin D to correct the deficiency could be beneficial.[PMID:35136207][PMID:34010550] Additional supplements that might improve menstrual-related symptoms (with varying levels of efficacy) include chaste tree, magnesium, vitamin B6 and B~1~, ginger, calcium, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin, and inositol.[PMID:27000311][PMID:19923637][PMID:28237870][PMID:22031267][PMID:32453393][PMID:29447494][PMID:34010550]  Another supplement that is often studied in menstruating people is iron because blood loss via menstruation can reduce iron levels in the body, especially if the bleeding is heavy.[PMID:35136207] Iron may also be lost during exercise.[PMID:35565904] Because iron is used to make red blood cells, a deficiency in iron can lead to [anemia], which means that the blood cannot carry enough oxygen throughout the body. Iron supplementation is an effective treatment for iron deficiency.[PMID:35488139][PMID:36182259] Before beginning any supplements, it is important for menstrual-related symptoms to be evaluated by a clinician. Some supplements, like iron, can cause damage if excessive amounts accumulate in the body.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2077/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,What are the phases of the menstrual cycle?,"The menstrual cycle is divided into two main phases: the follicular (or proliferative) phase and the luteal (or secretory) phase, both of which contain subphases (e.g., early follicular, late follicular, ovulatory, early luteal, late luteal). Each subphase is marked by a unique hormonal profile and an accompanied response from the reproductive organs.[PMID:24745832] The follicular phase lasts approximately 14 to 21 days, begins with menstruation (colloquially known as “a period”), and ends with ovulation. During this phase, [follicle stimulating hormone] causes follicles in the ovaries (which store eggs) to grow, and the lining of the uterus thickens as estrogen levels rise. About halfway through the cycle (around day 14), a surge in [luteinizing hormone] stimulates ovulation or the release of a mature egg(s) from the follicle. During the approximately 14 days of the luteal phase, the egg travels through the fallopian tube and into the uterus. Meanwhile, the follicle that released the egg (now called the corpus luteum) releases hormones, primarily [progesterone], which prepares the uterus for implantation of the egg, should it become fertilized. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum stops releasing hormones, progesterone and [estrogen] levels fall, and the lining of the uterus sheds in the form of bloody discharge through the vaginal canal. The time when bleeding begins is considered day 1 of the next menstrual cycle and the start of a new follicular phase.[PMID:31843564]The above description, although factual, does not capture the unique complexities of the menstrual cycle. The exact timing and amplitude of the peaks and troughs of reproductive hormones (as well as the menstrual cycle phases they bring about) vary both between and within individuals. Most of this dissimilarity is prompted by differences or changes in the length of the follicular phase, whereas the luteal phase remains relatively constant. On average, a person’s onset of menses can deviate by up to 4 days, compared to a previous cycle. The regularity of the menstrual cycle is also affected by age, with younger and older people more likely to experience cycle irregularities and anovulatory cycles (menstrual cycles that do not result in the release of an egg).[PMID:31843564]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2078/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,What are the signs and symptoms of the menstrual cycle?,"Many people experience certain signs and symptoms during different phases of the menstrual cycle, especially a few days before and during menstruation. This is usually due to hormone fluctuations, which can affect everything from digestion to mood to acne to joint laxity to sleep. Although each person’s menstrual cycle is unique, there are some common symptoms to note and track to better manage them. During menstruation, estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest, and, for some people, energy levels are equally low. Abdominal cramping, bloating, irritability, headaches, tender breasts, mood swings, and low back pain may also be experienced during this phase. If cramping is particularly intense and recurrent with each menses, it may be diagnosed as [dysmenorrhea] and should be assessed by a clinician for secondary causes, like [endometriosis].[PMID:16690671] As the follicular phase progresses and estrogen rises, the symptoms of menstruation should subside. Mood and energy levels often improve,[PMID:36672085] and, as ovulation nears, sexual desire may increase while hunger/appetite decreases.[PMID:23601091][PMID:28202355] When ovulation occurs, some people feel abdominal pain (called mittelschmerz), likely related to the rise in luteinizing hormone that stimulates prostaglandin production and the consequential contraction of the ovary to release an egg.[PMID:31747229]With ovulation complete, the luteal phase begins, and progesterone levels rise. The precise effects of progesterone on mood are unclear and likely affect people differently.[PMID:32723604] However, if a pregnancy does not occur, the subsequent drop in circulating progesterone and estrogen levels can cause negative symptoms. This is why the late luteal phase is often associated with food cravings, mood swings, gastrointestinal discomfort, breast tenderness, and poor sleep.[PMID:19301532][PMID:26043860][PMID:30098748] If the symptoms are severe, it may be a sign of [*premenstrual syndrome*] (PMS).",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2079/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,Can menstrual cycle measurements aid in achieving or preventing pregnancy?,"Outside of general health, many people measure the menstrual cycle with the goal of achieving or preventing a pregnancy. This requires detecting the time of ovulation because the likelihood of pregnancy is highest when sexual intercourse occurs during the period from 2 days before to the day of ovulation.[PMID:28228319] In people with a normal menstrual cycle, there are several simple, inexpensive ways to potentially predict the time of ovulation. These include menstrual cycle charting, oral basal body temperature monitoring, and assessing cervical mucus changes, although the reliability of these methods is questionable.[PMID:36610890] There are more accurate ways to detect ovulation. Commercially available tests determine the time of ovulation by measuring the levels of luteinizing hormone and/or estrogen metabolites in a urine sample or by carefully monitoring body temperature, either under the arm or in the vagina, with special devices.[PMID:29313033] People with an irregular menstrual cycle or difficulty getting pregnant may require more extensive testing to determine when and if ovulation is occurring, such as bloodwork and imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound). It is important to work with an experienced clinician for any menstruation or fertility issues.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2080/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,Can the menstrual cycle affect exercise performance?,"There is speculation that the rise and fall of hormones throughout the menstrual cycle could affect exercise performance. Put very simply, one prevailing theory is that performance may be enhanced during the late follicular phase, when menstruation and its potential accompanying symptoms are gone and estrogen (an anabolic hormone) is high, compared to the luteal phase, when progesterone is elevated, which may counteract the actions of estrogen, increase body temperature, and negatively affect recovery and neuromodulation.[PMID:35486372] However, whether exercise performance fluctuates alongside these hormonal shifts likely depends on the individual. For example, some people find that the symptoms of menstruation, like cramping and gastrointestinal discomfort, interfere with their ability to engage in athletic pursuits (especially if they suffer from dysmenorrhea or PMS), whereas other people are unaffected by menses.[PMID:33199360] This heterogeneity makes it difficult to prescribe general guidelines regarding exercise and the menstrual cycle.In fact, studies on the menstrual cycle and exercise performance have failed to find robust and consistent differences between performance (strength or aerobic) at different phases of the menstrual cycle.[PMID:37033884] A 2020 meta-analysis reported that in eumenorrheic female athletes, there may be a trivial reduction in exercise performance during the early follicular phase (the time of menses).[PMID:32661839] Other studies find that muscle recruitment and recovery may be impaired during the luteal phase, when progesterone is at its peak, but that this does not necessarily affect performance.[PMID:37033884][PMID:36833959] Nonetheless, menstrual-related symptoms can negatively affect a person’s perception of their performance, mental sharpness, and balance.[PMID:36111164] Studies of higher quality are needed to determine whether training based on menstrual cycle phases provides added benefit over that of a well-structured exercise program. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that the risk for exercise-related injuries (particularly ligament injuries) varies across the menstrual cycle, but it is possible that hormonal fluctuations increase the risk for injuries.[PMID:36833966][PMID:34745647][PMID:28795075]",

In fact, some studies find that the Mediterranean diet, low carbohydrate diets, and diets with too much fiber are associated with irregular menstrual cycles.[PMID:26082480][PMID:33465762] Still other studies report that in people with overweight and obesity, weight loss improves menstrual regularity more than a specific dietary composition.[PMID:12574218] This variety of findings highlights the importance of an individualized approach to diet.

In some people, cravings for sweet and salty foods, as well as overall appetite, may be increased during the luteal phase, compared to other phases.[PMID:26043860] This might be related, in part, to the way hormones can affect appetite, the perception of taste and smell, and water regulation.[PMID: 34444669]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2083/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,Could the menstrual cycle affect dietary intake and metabolism?,"The body’s ability to utilize certain macronutrients for energy appears to fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle. When estrogen is elevated during the follicular phase, carbohydrates are used more readily, and glycogen storage may be reduced. Conversely, when progesterone is elevated during the luteal phase, there is a greater breakdown of protein, increased utilization of fat, and a slight increase in basal metabolic rate.[PMID:34015236][PMID:36367830] Whether altering dietary macronutrient intake alongside these metabolic shifts is advantageous for health outcomes — including fertility, exercise performance, and menstrual-related symptoms — requires further research.",

[Menstrual cycle-based diets](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/nutrition-and-exercise-throughout-your-menstrual-cycle/) usually recommend some variation of the following: eating anti-inflammatory and iron-rich foods, (like salmon, red meat, and dark leafy green vegetables) during menstruation, eating “proestrogenic” foods (like flax seeds and kimchi) during the follicular phase, and eating foods that “balance” blood sugar and support progesterone (like complex carbohydrates, avocados, tofu, dark chocolate, and pumpkin seeds) during the luteal phase. These recommendations (e.g.,like eating iron-rich foods when losing blood through menstruation) certainly aren’t unhealthful or completely unfounded, but they are not an evidence-based way to “balance hormones”.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2085/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,Is “seed cycling” beneficial for hormonal health?,"There are no controlled trials on the practice of seed cycling for hormonal health, and, consequently, there is no evidence to support or refute its benefits to the menstrual cycle. Seed cycling involves eating specific seeds (e.g., pumpkin, flax, sesame, sunflower) during certain phases of the menstrual cycle to “support” hormone production and function. The idea is that as reproductive hormones ebb and flow, so too does the body’s nutritional needs, and different seeds can be cycled in and out of the diet to “match” these needs and thereby optimize hormonal health. During the follicular phase, flax seeds (which contain phytoestrogens) and pumpkin seeds (for micronutrients like zinc and magnesium) are consumed to support and “balance” the rise in estrogen. During the luteal phase, sunflower seeds (for micronutrients like vitamin E and selenium) and sesame seeds (for micronutrients like calcium and B vitamins) are consumed to support progesterone production. The “dosage” for each seed is 1 to 2 tablespoons per day, preferably raw and freshly ground.   Although there are no trials on seed cycling, there is some evidence on the effect of certain seeds and micronutrients on the menstrual cycle. For instance, a small crossover study in 18 women found that supplementation with flax seed powder reduced the number of anovulatory cycles (a menstrual cycle with no egg release), but there were no significant differences in estrogen levels.[PMID:8077314] Supplementation with zinc for 4 to 6 days before (and possibly during) menstruation may reduce menstrual pain in people with primary dysmenorrhea.[PMID:32824334] Similarly, calcium supplementation may reduce symptoms of PMS,[PMID:30918875] as may vitamin E supplementation.[PMID:36513486] A retrospective cohort study in infertile women with [PCOS] also found that vitamin E supplementation reduced markers of oxidative stress, but it did not improve ovulation or the chance of getting pregnant.[PMID:32252736] Seeds do contain important vitamins and minerals and can be a healthful addition to most diets. However, it is important to seek the help of a clinician if hormonal issues are suspected.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2086/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1263/edit,Menstrual Health,How do contraceptives affect the menstrual cycle?,"Certain contraceptives can affect the menstrual cycle. Two examples are oral contraceptive pills and intrauterine devices. Combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (colloquially known as “the birth control pill”) externally regulate the menstrual cycle by providing sex hormones in the form of a pill and consequently suppressing the body’s production of hormones. This inhibition of internal hormone formation means that ovulation does not occur, thus preventing pregnancy.[PMID:32666247] Some people find that oral contraceptives alleviate the symptoms of certain conditions, like dysmenorrhea and PCOS, but they may also have adverse effects.[PMID:17521249] The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/birth-control) is a good resource for more information on oral contraceptives.A *intrauterine device* (IUD) is a small device that is inserted into the uterus by a clinician to prevent pregnancies. IUDs are the most common form of long-acting, reversible birth control used worldwide.[PMID:24369300] In the United States, there are two main types of IUDs, ones that contain copper and ones that release the hormone levonorgestrel (a form of progesterone). Because these devices work locally, they usually do not suppress the body’s hormone production, and the menstrual cycle continues. However, they can have short-term and long-term effects on menstrual-related symptoms in some people. IUDs can increase cramping and bleeding and can cause unscheduled bleeding and spotting; this usually subsides within the first 6 months, but it can be severe and/or prolonged enough to cause discontinuation.[PMID:36017945][PMID:30170037] Conversely, in the long term, they can cause amenorrhea and lighter bleeding and can even reduce pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea.[PMID:30527945][PMID:32529637][PMID:31585615] It is important to speak with a clinician when weighing the risks and benefits of different contraceptives because the choice is highly individualized.",

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are ubiquitous and have been detected in human urine, blood, sweat, hair, and even breastmilk.[PMID:23213291][PMID:19594415]There is evidence suggesting that EDCs can negatively affect reproductive health. Exposure to certain air pollutants, parabens, and polybrominated biphenyls is associated with irregular menstrual cycles,[PMID:33027071] and EDCs may also increase the risk for ovarian aging (which may result in a decline in fertility).[PMID:35405219] More research is needed to determine the causal effects of EDCs in humans as well as the dosages at which they could potentially do harm.[PMID:26544531]",

It is believed that adequate intake of folic acid can alleviate anemia symptoms caused by the rapid breakdown of red blood cells in SCD patients. However, recent data analysis indicates that while supplementation with folic acid increases folate levels, it does not significantly impact hemoglobin concentration, anemia symptoms, pain crises, rate of infections, or hospitalizations.[PMID:26880182][Iron] deficiency is common in individuals with SCD, but there are conflicting opinions regarding supplementation with iron. On one hand, low iron levels may reduce painful crises by decreasing hemoglobin concentration in sickled red blood cells.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.10313|title=Iron in sickle cell disease: A review why less is better|authors=Koduri|journal=American Journal of Hematology|published=2003] On the other hand, iron deficiency can have a detrimental impact on both physical and mental growth, making adequate levels important. Until further studies are conducted, people with SCD should consult their doctor before starting any iron supplements.[Zinc] sulfate may also be a promising supplement for SCD. Studies show that it may reduce the frequency of pain crises if taken for a year, and it may reduce the number of infections after just three months of use. However, these findings are based on a small group of trials, and more studies should be conducted to verify its efficacy and safety.[PMID:23807756] Additionally, research is exploring the use of [Arginine|L-arginine] as an adjunct therapy to reduce vaso-occlusion and associated pain crises.

This type of gene inheritance pattern is called autosomal recessive, which means that disease happens only when both copies of the sickle cell gene are altered. This is possible only when both parents carry the mutation.[reference|url=https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/sickle-cell-disease|title=Sickle Cell Disease: MedlinePlus]People born with only one copy of the altered gene don’t usually manifest any symptoms and live a healthy life, although they can still pass the defective gene to their children.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2097/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1355/edit,Sickle Cell Disease,What can trigger a sickle cell pain crisis?,"Sickle cell crises are caused by constriction of the blood vessels due to the half-moon and stiff shape of sickled red blood cells. Some events or physical conditions can exacerbate this constriction, and therefore trigger a pain crisis. Cold weather, swimming in cold water, or sudden temperature changes may trigger a pain crisis, or exacerbate an existing one. Dehydration also plays an important role, so it’s best to drink plenty of water and reduce consumption of alcohol (a dehydrating substance). For people with SCD, it’s safe to do low-to-moderate intensity physical exercise, but strenuous activities that cause shortness of breath should be avoided, as strenuous exercise can result in a pain crisis and other complications. High altitude may also trigger pain crises and other complications, due to reduced oxygen. However, by staying hydrated, taking breaks, and gradually building up exercise intensity, people with SCD can safely travel to, and train at, high altitudes.Additionally, [anxiety] and mental stress can contribute to vasoconstriction and affect blood flow, which in turn may have a detrimental effect on people suffering from SCD.[PMID:30975906]",

They can be taken continuously, only during the luteal phase, or at the time of symptom onset through the first few days of menstruation. Symptoms should improve by the first menstrual cycle following SSRI treatment.[PMID:23744611] *Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors* (SNRIs) may also be used.[PMID:15349012] For people who desire contraception, a combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive can be prescribed, although oral contraceptives may not decrease depressive symptoms.[PMID:34224688] *Gonadotropin-releasing hormone* (GnRH) agonists in combination with low doses of estrogen and progesterone are reserved for people who do not respond to the aforementioned treatments.

The cyclic changes in sex hormones between people with and without PMDD are similar.[PMID:26377947][PMID:575318] Rather, in people with PMDD, the brain is highly sensitive to the hormonal shifts in the luteal phase, especially the rise in allopregnanolone, provoking an aberrant neurotransmitter response that negatively affects emotional regulation.[PMID:29072794][PMID:37055419][PMID:36575726] The opioid, [GABA], and serotonin systems have all been implicated in the pathology of PMDD, but the serotonin system appears to be the most important (likely underlying the effectiveness of  SSRIs for many people with PMDD).",

Unlike PMDD, in which there is no underlying psychiatric condition, premenstrual exacerbations occur in people who have a mood disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder) that is worsened during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Careful tracking of symptoms over at least two symptomatic menstrual cycles can help differentiate PMDD from premenstrual exacerbations, since PMDD only causes symptoms during a specific part of the luteal phase, while people with premenstrual exacerbations experience some level of psychiatric symptoms throughout the entire month.[PMID:34626258] There are also online [self-screening tools](https://iapmd.org/self-screen) to help people better differentiate between the two.",

It results in [erythema] (redness), flushing, [telangiectasia] (spider veins), and inflamed bumps. Rosacea can also affect the eyes (ocular rosacea) or cause thickening of the skin (phymatous changes). People with rosacea often experience episodes of remission and flare-ups, and some experience worsening of symptoms over time.[PMID:30585305][PMID:29089180]Unmanaged rosacea symptoms can negatively impact quality of life and psychological well-being, leading to low self-esteem, embarrassment, and an increased risk of anxiety and depression.[PMID:33759078][PMID:34879261] A 2018 meta-analysis estimated the global prevalence of rosacea to be 5.5%, with nearly all cases occurring in adults over 30.

These symptoms primarily affect skin on the cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead, and may be persistent or transient in nature. Flare-ups of flushing and/or erythema are common, and may occur following exposure to a trigger (e.g., heat, sun exposure, alcohol). Some people experience thickening of the skin, usually on the nose — a phenomenon called rhinophyma — which appears as nodular growths and bulbous enlargement of the nose.[PMID:33759078][PMID:30585305]More than half of people with rosacea experience symptoms in and around the eyes, including dryness, burning, itching, redness, sensitivity to light, inflammation of the eyes or eyelids, and rarely, inflammation of the cornea;  the latter can lead to vision loss.[PMID:33759078][PMID:30585305]",

Treatment should be managed by a health care practitioner, and tailored to the individual’s current symptoms. Given that symptoms of rosacea can vary between people and even within the same person over time, practitioners will generally  focus on addressing the symptoms most bothersome to the individual at that time. Management options include both oral and topical (applied to the skin) medications and laser and light-based therapies.[PMID:33759078][PMID:30585305] For managing [erythema] (facial redness), health care practitioners may prescribe topical medications that constrict superficial blood vessels, such as brimonidine and oxymetazoline. These medications work quickly, often within 30 minutes, with effects lasting for up to 12 hours.[PMID:30585305][PMID:36846769] For reducing papules and pustules, health care practitioners may turn to medications with anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Topical medications like ivermectin, azelaic acid, metronidazole, and minocycline are often tried first. If topical medications fail to control symptoms, health care practitioners may prescribe oral medications such as tetracycline antibiotics or isotretinoin. All of these medications work slowly over time when used consistently.[PMID:30585305][PMID:36846769] For eye irritation, health care practitioners may prescribe eye ointments containing cyclosporine or antibiotics, lubricating eye drops, as well as some of the oral therapies previously mentioned.[PMID:30585305]Finally, health care practitioners may recommend lasers and intense pulsed light therapy to help reduce visible blood vessels, redness, and skin thickening (phyma), although skin thickening may sometimes require surgical correction.[PMID:33759078]",

Skincare products that cause a burning sensation, or trigger symptoms, should be avoided.[PMID:33852244][PMID:32035944] Some alternative treatments with a less substantial evidence base are being explored. Hydroxychloroquine is a common treatment for some autoimmune diseases, due to its ability to reduce inflammation through immune system modulation. One small trial found that people with rosacea who took oral hydroxychloroquine saw similar improvements in their rosacea symptoms as those who took doxycycline. This effect is supported by mechanistic studies in mice, but more human studies are needed to determine the role of this medication.[PMID:32439466][PMID: 31918061]Topical benzoyl peroxide, an established medication for acne, may also have a role in rosacea.

However, there is evidence regarding cow’s milk allergy that suggests irregular ingestion in early life may promote allergy, supporting the idea that once a potentially allergenic food is successfully introduced into the diet it should be consumed regularly (a few times weekly) to prevent loss of tolerance.[PMID:27157937]For short- or long-term formula-fed infants, replacing regular cow’s milk or soy formula with a formula that is partially or extensively hydrolyzed (proteins are broken down into smaller pieces) is likely not effective for preventing food allergies.[PMID:30338526][PMID:26956579] Similarly, while breastfeeding is associated with a multitude of health benefits for the infant, it has not consistently been found to help prevent food allergies.[PMID:25843315]",

However, 75% of people undergoing oral immunotherapy experienced allergy-related side effects, and 8.4% experienced anaphylaxis. This emphasizes the importance of oral immunotherapy only being done under the direct guidance and supervision of an allergy specialist.[PMID:29676439]Note that immunotherapy is generally not recommended for children with mild or moderate reactions, as the majority of them will “outgrow” their egg allergy by age 16 and require no intervention afterward.[Study Summary: Oral immunotherapy for egg white allergy](https://examine.com/summaries/study/d3orjd/)",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2149/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1416/edit,Egg Allergy,What causes egg allergy?,"Egg allergy, like other food allergies, occurs when there is a breakdown in immune system tolerance. Normally, the immune system is unresponsive to egg, but in egg allergy, the immune system becomes sensitized to egg protein and generates egg-specific IgE-antibodies. Upon re-exposure to egg, an IgE-mediated immune response occurs, which causes the release of histamine and other chemical mediators that create the symptoms of an allergic reaction. It’s not known why this loss of tolerance occurs in some people, but it likely involves a combination of genetic predisposition to immune sensitivity to eggs and environmental exposures that bring out such predispositions.[PMID:28609025] Currently, there are two leading theories identified by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine: The “microbial exposure hypothesis” suggests that reduced exposure to microbes early in life may hinder the development of the early immune system, leading to inappropriate reactivity; the “dual allergen exposure hypothesis”  suggests that a damaged skin barrier (e.g., as seen in eczema) may allow for the absorption of food allergens through the skin before they have been introduced orally, leading to sensitization.[PMID:28609025] Ultimately, more research is needed to fully understand what causes egg allergy, and the causes are likely multifactorial.",

While initial interactions with the immune system through the gastrointestinal tract are suggested to promote oral *tolerance*, exposure through the skin may instead promote *sensitization* — a prerequisite for food allergy. This is merely a theory and a causal relationship has not been confirmed. However, research has found that children may be sensitized to egg proteins before the oral introduction of egg; eczema usually precedes egg allergy; the risk of food allergy increases with increasing eczema severity; early oral introduction may prevent allergy; and genetic mutations leading to impaired skin barrier function are associated with an increased risk of food allergies.[PMID: 25174864][PMID:36695076][PMID:31846795][PMID:27523961]",

Any positive effects that were noted in the included trials were small, and no two trials found significant changes across the same neuropsychological tests.[PMID:33436817] A 2022 systematic review on the use of *Bacopa* for Alzheimer’s disease also reported no clinically meaningful differences with *Bacopa monnieri* treatment.[PMID:35612544] Moreover, many of the trials that do report cognitive benefits from *Bacopa monnieri* fail to adjust for multiple comparisons despite measuring a number of different outcomes,[PMID:12093601] and the cognitive tests that are used are not always appropriate for the population being studied.[PMID:36936504] There is some preliminary research suggesting that *Bacopa monnieri* could have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, possibly by reducing cortisol secretion and the depletion of dopamine and serotonin during chronic stress, but more research is needed to confirm this effect.[PMID:33436817][PMID:35612544] Overall, the evidence for *Bacopa monnieri* is too heterogeneous to come to a firm conclusion about efficacy. It might improve some aspects of memory, cognition, and mood in certain people, but it could also have no substantial effects on any aspects of health.",

Anecdotally, some people experience a lack of motivation after taking *Bacopa*, likely due to its anxiolytic (anxiety reducing) effects.[PMID:23788517] A rat study reported a reversible decrease in sperm count, motility, and viability at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day, but there are no human studies on *Bacopa* and fertility.[PMID:19041444]",

Bacosides may also modulate stress hormones within the brain and positively interact with the serotonin, dopamine, and cholinergic systems, which helps to explain *Bacopa’s* possible mood-related effects.[PMID:21129470][PMID:35612544] Furthermore, *Bacopa monnieri* has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.[PMID:22408313]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2207/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/248/edit,Bacopa Monnieri,Does *Bacopa monnieri* work better in combination with other supplements?,"In some trials, *Bacopa monnieri* was studied as a combination supplement, with the goal of enhanced therapeutic benefits. *Bacopa monnieri* has been used alongside a number of other herbs and vitamins, with mixed results. For example, a 4-week trial combining 300 mg of *bacopa monnieri* with 120 mg of [ginkgo biloba] found no improvements in any cognitive outcomes when compared to placebo, but the study was relatively short in duration and may not have used an optimal dose of ginkgo biloba.[PMID:14994318] Conversely, a 2-month pilot study examining a nutraceutical containing 320 mg of *Bacopa monnieri*, 100 mg of [L-theanine], 30 mg of [saffron], 2 mg of [copper], and some vitamins (9.5 mg of vitamin B6, 450 mcg of biotin, 400 mcg of folic acid, 33 mcg of vitamin B12, and 25 mcg of vitamin D), reported cognitive improvements with supplementation in participants with cognitive impairment.[PMID:29188854] *Bacopa monnieri* is also used in two polyherbal formulations. Protandim is combination supplement made up of [ashwagandha], *Bacopa* extract, green tea extract, [silymarin], and [curcumin].[PMID:19056485] Perment is a combination supplement made up of *Bacopa monnieri*, ashwagandha, [butterfly pea], and [*Asparagus racemosus*].[PMID:21614890] There is little research on either of these polyherbal supplements. It is possible they provide more benefit than *Bacopa* on its own, but, without well-designed human trials, it is difficult to determine their clinical efficacy. *Bacopa monnieri* may also work synergistically with rosemary. One *in vitro* study found that *Bacopa monnieri* in combination with rosemary (*Rosmarinus officinalis*) had stronger antioxidant effects than either supplement on its own.[PMID:4647092] Similarly, a study using a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease found that oral administration of  *Bacopa monnieri* and *Rosmarinus officinalis* could have neuroprotective effects.[reference|https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334794789_Chemical_fingerprint_of_Bacopa_monnieri_L_and_Rosmarinus_officinalis_L_and_their_neuroprotective_activity_against_Alzheimers_disease_in_rat_models_putative_modulation_via_cholinergic_and_monoaminergic|title=Chemical fingerprint of Bacopa monnieri L. and Rosmarinus officinalis L. and their neuroprotective activity against Alzheimers disease in rat models putative modulation via cholinergic and monoaminergic pathways|published=2019 JUN|authors=Waly N, Aborehab N, Bishbishy M|journal=J of Medicinal Plant Research] There is no human evidence to support these findings. Keep in mind that although there is nothing inherently wrong with combination supplements, it is a challenge to deduce which components of these supplements are actually causing any beneficial effects. Thus, any benefits cannot be directly attributed to *Bacopa monnieri*.",

More robust study designs are needed to determine the efficacy of *Bacopa* in children and adolescents. There was also a 2022 randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of *Bacopa monnieri’s* ability to reduce attention and hyperactivity in male children ages 6 to 14.[PMID:35041248] No differences were noted for behavioral outcomes, but there were some improvements in the *Bacopa* group for certain cognitive outcomes, such as cognitive flexibility and processing speed. It is essential for parents to discuss supplements with a clinician before administering them to a child, as children can have different reactions to supplements than adults.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2210/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/248/edit,Bacopa Monnieri,Could *Bacopa monnieri* interact with medications?,"*Bacopa monnieri* may interact with certain medications, including those commonly used for neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, although research in this area is limited. Because *Bacopa monnieri* may affect the serotonin, dopamine, and cholinergic systems, it is possible it could interact with pharmaceuticals that act on these systems. This includes anticholinergic medications, like those used to treat [glaucoma] and [Alzheimer’s disease]. Additionally, an *in vitro* study found that *Bacopa monnieri* inhibited the activity of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and could therefore cause significant adverse reactions when taken alongside drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, like clozapine, haloperidol, fluoxetine, and phenytoin.[PMID:24566323] In a case study, a patient taking cevimeline (a cholinergic agonist that stimulates saliva production and is metabolized by P450 enzymes) experienced malaise, nausea, and tachycardia after taking a supplement containing *Bacopa monnieri*. The clinicians suspected cholinergic toxicity due to the herb-drug interaction. Symptoms resolved once the supplement was discontinued.[PMID:35765109] There is also rat research that found *Bacopa* could substantially increase thyroxine levels (T4), meaning it could interact with thyroid medications.[PMID:12065164] Other possible interactions that have not yet been documented could also exist. This is why it is very important to speak with a clinician before taking *Bacopa monnieri*, especially when it will be used in combination with prescription medications.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2211/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1459/edit,Orthorexia Nervosa,What is orthorexia nervosa?,"Orthorexia nervosa is an excessive preoccupation with healthy eating that results in negative social consequences and severe psychological distress, particularly when elements of the diet deviate from someone's perception of “healthy”. Orthorexia nervosa may involve rigid dietary rules about how foods are bought, prepared, and consumed and strict avoidance of foods or ingredients that are perceived to be unhealthy, impure, or harmful. These self-imposed dietary rules may escalate over time. The ideas of “healthy” versus “unhealthy” eating habits in orthorexia nervosa are generally based on someone’s own perceptions rather than more objective definitions of healthy eating (such as published dietary guidelines). Despite this lack of objectivity, people with orthorexia nervosa may view their eating habits as superior to those of others.[PMID:34921564][PMID:37106441]  Orthorexia nervosa is associated with health anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, low physical self-esteem, and perfectionism. First identified in 1997, orthorexia nervosa is not yet classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and research is still in the process of determining whether orthorexia nervosa is a standalone disorder or a subtype of a pre-existing disorder such as [anorexia nervosa] or [*obsessive-compulsive disorder*] (OCD).[PMID:37106441][PMID:35750289]",

[PMID:34921564]Dietary rules might include cutting out entire categories of foods for no reason beyond viewing them as “unhealthy” or “impure”  (e.g., gluten, dairy, added sugars, carbohydrates, fats, preservatives, pesticides, oils, animal products). In orthorexia nervosa, beliefs about how foods and ingredients affect health are overvalued, meaning that the believed positive or negative impacts of a food on health are exaggerated. This can lead to extreme anxiety/distress and guilt when “unhealthy” foods are consumed or when “healthy” foods are unavailable.[PMID:34921564][PMID:37106441] The dietary restriction that occurs in orthorexia nervosa can lead to weight loss and nutritional deficiencies; however, the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and weight is not clearly understood. Some research suggests that, unlike the eating disorders [anorexia nervosa] or [bulimia nervosa], orthorexia nervosa is not driven by negative body image and a desire for thinness.

If a clinician makes a diagnosis of orthorexia nervosa, it will likely be based on a thorough patient history and clinical judgment.Several diagnostic questionnaires have been proposed, but most have major limitations and questionable validity. For example, some of the most widely used questionnaires in orthorexia nervosa research do not distinguish between orthorexia nervosa and “healthy orthorexia” (a general interest in healthy eating that is not harmful), which results in overestimated rates of orthorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to a) determine whether orthorexia nervosa is indeed a standalone diagnosis and b) create a diagnostic tool that can identify orthorexia nervosa with accuracy and specificity.[PMID:34921564][PMID:26902744][PMID:37106441]",

Healthy eating is prioritized, but there is not an unhealthy fixation on it, and there is diet flexibility, meaning that deviations from the perceived healthy diet can occur without inducing the psychological distress or guilt that occur in orthorexia nervosa. Healthy orthorexia has been positively correlated with overall well-being, positive emotions, and mindfulness. Additionally, studies have found that healthy orthorexia either does not correlate (or negatively correlates) with disordered eating, perfectionism, OCD symptoms, and negative emotions. Interestingly, like orthorexia nervosa, healthy orthorexia does not necessarily mean that the perceived healthy diet is in line with objective definitions of healthy eating.[PMID:37106441][PMID:34275120][PMID:30934544] Currently, there is only one orthorexia nervosa measurement tool that differentiates between healthy orthorexia and orthorexia nervosa – the Teruel Othorexia Scale.",

These populations include people who practice yoga or go to the gym, dietitians, medical students, and athletes. However, given that most orthorexia measurement tools used in this research did not differentiate between orthorexia nervosa and healthy orthorexia, it is possible that these higher prevalence rates are due to the tendency of these populations to be more health conscious. Further, some research in the general population has reported rates of orthorexia nervosa of up to 88%, which again calls into question the validity of orthorexia measurement tools. Further research with more specific measurement tools and larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings.[PMID:26902744][PMID:32356144] [PMID:30343447][PMID:24852286][PMID:17586085]",

Total muscle mass and muscle strength are strongly correlated,[PMID:34617822][PMID:11990746] so one might expect that the rate of decline for muscle mass and muscle strength would be more similar than they are. The primary reason for this discrepancy seems to be the type of muscle atrophy occurring. Muscle fibers come in different types based on their speed of contraction and metabolism, and they are generally categorized as slow-twitch (type I) and fast-twitch (type II). Type I muscle fibers contract relatively slowly and are more resistant to fatigue, whereas type II muscle fibers contract with more velocity and produce significantly more power but are quick to fatigue.Older adults predominantly experience a reduction in the size of type II muscle fibers, while type I muscle fiber size (and perhaps even their potential for hypertrophy) is preserved.[PMID:36268622] Furthermore, there’s evidence to suggest that type II muscle fibers in older adults are less sensitive to calcium,[PMID:25809942][PMID:29247790][PMID:33862138] which is detrimental for force production, as calcium triggers muscle contraction.Other factors thought to contribute to the decline in muscle function with aging are a progressive increase in myosteatosis (i.e., fat infiltration within skeletal muscle),[PMID:32903666] satellite cell loss and dysfunction,[PMID:24122288][PMID:21960527] and mitochondrial dysfunction.[PMID:37111021]",

Fortunately, emerging evidence suggests that lifting relatively light loads (approximately 35%–50% of 1-repetition maximum) exerts similar benefits,[PMID:31244666][PMID:32664408] particularly when each set is performed to volitional fatigue. This suggests that meaningful improvements in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance can be achieved by performing resistance exercise using one’s own body weight or with minimal equipment (e.g., ankle weights, elastic bands), as long as the individual is exerting a high degree of effort during their workouts.It’s recommended that from midlife on, adults interested in healthy muscle aging perform resistance exercise at least twice per week.[PMID:31244666] The program should be progressive in nature  (i.e., there is an increase in the number of repetitions performed or the amount of load lifted over time) and each workout should comprise a full-body approach with multiple sets (about 2–4) performed per exercise.[PMID:31233069]",

Hemorrhoids result from the pathological enlargement of anal cushions. Anal cushions are a part of anal anatomy that help maintain continence (the ability to control bowel movements) by filling with blood to seal the rectum, and draining during defecation. If this filling and draining process isn’t working properly, they can become enlarged and cause symptoms. Hemorrhoids are generally not harmful, apart from causing discomfort.[PMID:16235372] Hemorrhoids are a common condition, with a U.S. survey finding a prevalence of 4.4% in the general public. However, some research reports rates of up to 40%.[PMID:2295392][PMID:21932016] Hemorrhoids affect both sexes equally and prevalence peaks between ages 45 and 65.[PMID:2295392] It’s suggested that by age 50, roughly half of people will have experienced hemorrhoids at some point in their life.[PMID:37082684]",

Sometimes, mucousy discharge or fecal soiling may also occur.[PMID:16235372] If bleeding occurs, it is usually bright red, painless, and may be visible during or right after a bowel movement in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper.[PMID:30421308] A study that assessed the frequency of hemorrhoids in participants undergoing colorectal cancer screening found that over half of individuals with hemorrhoid disease did not have any symptoms.[PMID:21932016] Symptoms can also depend on the type of hemorrhoid. External hemorrhoids may be visible as a swollen bump on the anal opening and can be quite painful, as the area has many nerves for sensing pain. Alternatively, internal hemorrhoids are usually not visible unless they are prolapsed (the blood vessel becomes displaced and protrudes out of the anus) and are often painless, as there are no pain receptors in that region of the rectum. Both types of hemorrhoids can become thrombosed, during which a harmless (but painful) blood clot forms in the hemorrhoid.[PMID:16235372][PMID:37082684]Many of the symptoms of hemorrhoids can occur due to other more serious health conditions and therefore proper diagnosis by a healthcare provider is always recommended.[PMID:16235372]",

Sometimes an endoscope may be required to diagnose internal hemorrhoids. The endoscope is a small tube with a light and camera that is inserted into the rectum to evaluate the inner tissues.[PMID:16235372][PMID:21932016]  Internal hemorrhoids are often graded based on the degree of prolapse:[PMID:29431977]- Grade I: painless swelling of the hemorrhoid occurs.- Grade II: hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus during bowel movements and spontaneously returns to normal position.- Grade III: hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus during bowel movements and must be manually returned to position.- Grade IV: hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus during bowel movements and cannot be returned to position.",

A meta-analysis of controlled trials found that fiber supplementation, most often [psyllium], reduced the risk of overall hemorrhoid symptoms by half and was particularly effective for reducing the risk of bleeding. However, it can take up to 6 weeks for these benefits to take effect. Once hemorrhoids have healed, fiber supplementation can be continued as a preventative measure.[PMID:16235372]Bioflavonoid supplementation, particularly *micronized purified flavonoid fraction* (MPFF) containing 90% diosmin and 10% [hesperidin], was assessed in two recent meta-analyses of controlled trials. One meta-analysis reported a reduction in bleeding, anal leakage, and overall symptoms, while the other only found an effect for reduced bleeding.[PMID:32399811][PMID:30012392] MPFF is thought to work by reducing vein inflammation and increasing vein tone (the tightness of the vein).[PMID:32399811] While these products are commonly used in other parts of the world, they are not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for hemorrhoid treatment.[PMID:29431977]",

During pregnancy, the combination of increased blood volume (more circulating blood) and a rise in abdominal pressure from the growing fetus can cause blood to pool in the rectal/anal region.[PMID:34485376] Additionally, progesterone, a hormone that is elevated during pregnancy, relaxes smooth muscles in the walls of veins and the gastrointestinal tract. Veins may become more relaxed, allowing vessels to dilate and blood to pool, while gut motility slows, which can contribute to constipation. Reduced physical activity and changes in diet may also contribute to constipation during pregnancy.[PMID:35490229][PMID:34485376] During labor, vaginal delivery creates an immense amount of pressure in the abdomen and rectal area, which can lead to, or worsen, hemorrhoids. Factors that may increase the risk of hemorrhoids during pregnancy and postpartum include a history of constipation or anal problems, straining for more than 20 minutes during delivery, and a newborn birth weight of more than 3,800 grams (8 lbs, 6 oz).[PMID:24810254]Consuming a high-fiber diet with adequate fluids and staying active may help to prevent hemorrhoids in pregnancy and postpartum. A randomized controlled trial found that dietary and behavioral modifications reduced the risk of hemorrhoids by 60%. The dietary component included daily consumption of at least 1.5 liters of fluids, bran (1 tablespoon), 2 to 5 prunes, a serving of nuts, and several servings of fruits and vegetables.

Deficiency in certain nutrients may result in [fatigue], tiredness, [gut health] issues (such as [constipation]), abnormal heart rhythm, [hair loss], or dry skin. Other physical signs commonly associated with ARFID include weight loss, difficulties in reaching expected weight (particularly in children), and the absence or irregularity of menstrual periods in women.[PMID:31134139]It is important to acknowledge that individuals with ARFID can also be [overweight] or maintain a healthy weight despite being affected by the disorder. This situation often occurs when their diet primarily consists of high-energy foods that lack nutritional value.

Meeting one or more of these criteria is necessary for diagnosis.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cppeds.2017.02.005|title=Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)|authors=Zimmerman et al.|journal=Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care|published=2017-04] Individuals who have a healthy weight or are overweight but have nutritional deficiencies or other symptoms should also be screened for ARFID.[PMID:35565707][PMID:30636013][reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nurpra.2020.08.011|title=Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder—More Than Just Picky Eating: A Case Discussion and Literature Review|authors=Davis et al.|journal=The Journal for Nurse Practitioners|published=2020-11-01]Medical professionals typically analyze blood and urine samples to check for nutritional deficiencies and to identify biomarkers of other underlying medical conditions. Ruling out other medical or mental health conditions that may better explain the food restriction and/or avoidance behavior is also a diagnostic criterion for ARFID. For instance, if the food restriction stems from body image and weight concerns, the individual cannot be diagnosed with ARFID because these are typical symptoms of other eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.  Moreover, medical professionals need to ensure that the food restriction is not due to a lack of access to food or deliberate dieting or fasting for personal or religious reasons because these are regarded as exclusion criteria.

Another promising psychological treatment is a modified version of *family-based therapy* (FBT), which was originally used for other eating disorders but has been adapted specifically for ARFID. This approach provides support to people with ARFID, as well as their caregivers and family, while fostering recovery within the home environment and reducing tensions within the family unit.[PMID:32283448][PMID:32477172][PMID:35565707] The effectiveness of these methods should be further investigated through randomized controlled studies.People with ARFID, particularly children who don’t ingest enough calories, may also require supplementation with nutritional formulas, oral supplements, or tube feeding.[PMID:28714048]Some pharmacological treatments (e.g.,  olanzapine, mirtazapine, cyproheptadine) are being explored as adjunct therapies for ARFID to reduce anxiety related to food and stimulate appetite.

Clinicians typically use tests to assess the individual‘s nutritional status and in some cases may prescribe specific nutritional formulas, oral supplements (e.g., multivitamins), or tube feeding to compensate for the lack of nutrients. However, these measures are usually temporary and are supported by other therapeutic strategies aimed at reintroducing foods or increasing overall food intake in the long term.[PMID:28714048]It is important to note that it’s quite common for people diagnosed with ARFID to overuse supplements (e.g., multivitamins, nutritional formula) or to be dependent on supplements to compensate for the lack of nutrients in their diet. Although this is not considered a healthy behavior, introducing some nutrients is better than none at all. Clinicians, families, and caregivers are encouraged to avoid abruptly changing these habits and instead work on gradual strategies to incorporate new foods or increase food consumption over time.[PMID:35565707]",

The tube can be inserted through the nose or mouth or via a surgical procedure. The specific formulas or enteral food preparations used vary depending on the specific nutrient needs of the individual. Tube feeding is used to increase dietary volume and is always supported by other nutritional and psychological strategies aimed at gradually reintroducing foods and re-establishing regular feeding patterns.[PMID:28714048][PMID:35565707]",

This method appears to be particularly suitable for children who are hypersensitive to food or who associate food with negative emotions and/or negative body sensations. The FBI approach uses games and various cartoon characters to enhance children's self-awareness. It aims to teach children to not immediately reject uncomfortable body sensations (such as fast breathing or [hunger]) or unpleasant feelings triggered by external stimuli (such as olfactory stimuli). Instead, it encourages children to “investigate” these sensations through play, eventually helping them perceive them as interesting.[PMID:30597590][PMID:35565707] Although this approach is a step forward in the management of ARFID, larger studies are required to prove the effectiveness of this method.Another method that is already in use for eating disorders and is being explored for ARFID is called *food chaining*. This method aims to introduce new foods into the diets of individuals with ARFID by associating the characteristics of foods that they consider safe to eat with those of other foods that should be introduced or that the individual wants to be able to eat. Food chaining is a gradual process, and foods are introduced one at a time or a few at a time.[PMID:35565707] Future research should focus on examining the effectiveness of this method specifically for ARFID patients.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2295/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1536/edit,Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,What causes avoidant restrictive food intake disorder?,"The exact cause of ARFID is still unknown. ARFID has been included in the DSM only since 2013, and research on the neurobiology of this disorder is currently limited. It is understood that ARFID can be triggered by a sensitivity to the taste, texture, or smell of food, by negative associations with certain food-related body sensations, or by a lack of interest in food. However the underlying causes of these triggers are not clearly understood, and it is likely that a combination of psychological, environmental, and biological factors contribute to the development of ARFID.Hypotheses have been proposed based on existing studies of conditions that share similarities with ARFID.  Sensory hypersensitivity may contribute to the rejection of food based on taste, smell, or texture, which has been observed both in adults and children identified as “picky eaters”. A decreased activation of the brain’s appetite-regulating centers may be associated with a lack of interest in food. On the other hand, the rejection of food due to fear of adverse events, such as choking or vomiting, may be related to hyperactivation of specific areas of the brain involved in fear responses, such as the amygdala, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate.[PMID:28714048]Genetics may also play a role in the development of ARFID. One study conducted in Swedish children between the ages of 6 and 12 indicated a heritability rate of up to 79% for ARFID. However, this study has several limitations, and the methodologies used to collect data and diagnose ARFID were not robust, so these results should be interpreted cautiously.[PMID:36723946]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2296/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1536/edit,Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,Is ARFID the same as “picky eating”?,"Children and adults with ARFID are often mislabeled as “picky or fussy eaters” because there are some similarities between the two that can complicate the diagnosis of ARFID. *“Picky eating”* (PE) is a common behavior during childhood in which children may avoid certain foods based on their preferences for taste, smell, or texture. These preferences typically evolve and become more flexible as the child grows, particularly during puberty and adolescence. In contrast, ARFID involves a persistent aversion to food that extends beyond childhood and adolescence and can also develop in adulthood.[PMID:30636013]People with ARFID often struggle to meet their required intake of nutrients and energy, which may result in signs of being underweight, failure to reach expected weight (in children), or being overweight. Moreover, people with ARFID may refuse food due to intense fear or heightened sensitivity, which are not typically associated with “picky eating”. A study comparing children with ARFID, PE, or autism found that children with ARFID displayed the lowest food responsiveness, indicating a comparatively lower appetite.[PMID:31310945]Although ARFID has distinct signs and symptoms, not everyone experiences them or experiences them with the same intensity, making the distinction between “picky eating” and ARFID sometimes unclear. Therefore, further research is necessary to better understand the differences between these eating behaviors.",

Preliminary research suggests that the factors driving food avoidance and/or restriction in children with ASD often overlap with those observed in people with ARFID, with sensory sensitivity as a primary factor. However, because ARFID has only been included in the DSM since 2013, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of this co-occurrence, and a causal relationship between ARFID and ASD has not been established. When screening children for ARFID, it is important to consider the possibility of other conditions such as ASD. Equally, “picky eating” behaviors observed in children with ASD should not be disregarded as normal features of the disorder. It is essential to screen children with ASD for ARFID as early as possible to prevent situations of malnutrition, which can have even more severe consequences in people with ASD.[PMID:35565707][PMID:35112345]",

However, it is possible for both conditions to coexist. Research indicates that people with GI disorders, including *disorders of gut–brain interaction* (DGBI), often eliminate specific foods (such as dairy products or carbohydrates) based on their assumptions about what triggers their GI symptoms. When this behavior becomes consistent, it can evolve into a restrictive eating disorder like ARFID. Failing to recognize the presence of ARFID and attributing the food restriction solely to the GI disorder or symptoms can result in the oversight of appropriate treatments.[PMID:34028851][PMID:37079861]Moreover, people with undiagnosed ARFID who also experience GI symptoms may struggle to adhere to dietary recommendations. By independently deciding which foods to avoid or restrict, they may inadvertently worsen their GI symptoms, which can create a cycle of fear associated with eating specific foods. Although avoiding certain foods is quite common in people with GI disorders, clinicians should carefully monitor eating behaviors and screen for the presence of ARFID to ensure that the appropriate treatment is provided.[PMID:34028851][PMID:33244769][PMID:37079861]",

Although ghrelin has an orexigenic effect (stimulates hunger) and is released before eating or during fasting, PYY is an anorexigenic (subdues hunger) hormone that is normally released after meals to promote satiety. Studies on *anorexia nervosa* (AN) have shown that people with AN have higher levels of both ghrelin and PYY during fasting and after a meal, compared to people without AN, despite not experiencing an increase in appetite as expected with higher ghrelin levels. To investigate the role of these hunger-regulating hormones in underweight people with ARFID, one study from 2021 compared fasting and postprandial (postmeal) levels of ghrelin and PYY in participants with low-weight ARFID or AN and a control group of participants without these conditions.[PMID:34049199]The study found that participants with low-weight ARFID had lower levels of both fasting and postprandial ghrelin compared to the AN group but had levels similar to those of the control group. Additionally, over 50% of the low-weight ARFID participants showed an earlier postprandial spike of PYY compared to participants without ARFID or AN, which could explain the quick feeling of fullness after starting to eat. Contrary to expectations, the study findings indicated that participants with low-weight ARFID showed an earlier spike in PYY hormone compared to the control participants. These results suggest a potential dysregulation of the PYY hormone in individuals with low-weight ARFID, which may contribute to their low appetite and rapid satiety. [PMID:34049199]Further investigation is needed to determine whether the differences in PYY and ghrelin levels could serve as biomarkers to differentiate between AN and ARFID and guide appropriate therapeutic interventions. It is important to note that this study had several limitations, including the sample size, age differences among groups, and the lack of data on ghrelin and PYY levels in individuals with low weight but no known health conditions.[PMID:34049199]",

(Hirata’s disease)?,"Alpha-lipoic acid is not likely an independent cause of Hirata’s disease, but it may be a trigger in susceptible people.  A fundamental aspect of autoimmune disease is the loss of immune tolerance to the “self”, causing the immune system to attack the body’s own proteins and tissues. The causal factors resulting in this loss of self-tolerance are typically elusive, but commonly involve both genetic and environmental factors. For example, people with lupus often receive their initial diagnosis after a severe sunburn. Sunburn doesn’t cause autoimmune disease by itself, but it may be a trigger for a lifelong battle with autoimmunity in a genetically predisposed individual. *Insulin autoimmune syndrome* (IAS) is a rare disease caused by an autoimmune response to insulin.[PMID: 10445096] IAS is associated with high insulin levels and hypoglycemia (particularly after consuming a meal), as well as high levels of antibodies against insulin.[PMID: 23979685] The cause of IAS isn’t clear, but it has been associated with certain variants in *human leukocyte antigen* (HLA) genes. The HLA genes encode specialized sets of proteins that help the immune system distinguish “self” molecules of the body from harmful foreign pathogens. There is a strong association with certain HLA variants and different types of autoimmunity, which seems to also be the case for people with IAS induced by *lipoic acid* (LA).[PMID: 30532998]IAS can be triggered by LA, as well as other drugs.[PMID: 23979685] Although not completely understood, the mechanism by which LA or other drugs may trigger IAS in susceptible individuals may occur because LA disrupts disulfide bonds in the insulin molecule. LA and other drugs known to trigger IAS have in common the presence of sulfhydryl groups capable of disrupting (reducing) one or more disulfide bonds in insulin molecules.[PMID: 23979685][PMID: 24396698][PMID: 18042740] In people with certain HLA gene variants, this may be sufficient to trigger an autoimmune response against insulin.[PMID: 24111525]Although 80% of cases of IAS tend to be transient and resolve within 3–6 months after discontinuing the instigating agent and receiving medical treatment,[PMID: 16670629]PMID: 30532998] some people may develop chronic hypoglycemia.[PMID: 23979685]Recovery from LA-induced IAS may be immediate (within two days or a single week) or may take two months and require corticosteroid treatment.[PMID: 17586737] [PMID:33821530]## Symptoms of IASAutonomic nervous system symptoms and neurological hypoglycemia are the main clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia, occurring mostly during the night and early morning.

While specific data on LA-induced IAS are lacking, data from Japan estimate the number of cases in the general population to be 0.017 per 100,000 people (i.e. a total of 22 cases in these years).[PMID: 31742894] The numbers are presumably much lower in Europe.[PMID: 24111525]For supplement users, it still makes sense to closely monitor whether potential side effects occur, especially after meals and long(er) periods of fasting.",

Tirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist — it stimulates [insulin] release and increases levels of the hormone [adiponectin], reducing [blood glucose] and appetite.[PMID: 36251836]Another weight loss drug, orlistat, prevents the fat (and fat calories) from foods from being absorbed by the intestines — it is known as a lipase inhibitor.",

It should be noted that lean mass loss is not always muscle mass loss *per se*, as lean mass comprises muscle, but also bone, connective tissue, organs, and body water content. The goal of most fat loss programs is to improve [body composition] — in other words, to increase the body’s proportion of lean mass to fat mass. Most clinical trials of weight loss drugs such as semaglutide and other GLP-1 agonists (e.g., tirzepatide) report weight loss as a secondary if not a primary outcome, and the results don’t seem to indicate a disproportionate loss of muscle mass. For example, in a 72-week study comparing once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) to placebo, fat loss was 34% on average, and the ratio of total fat mass to lean mass decreased from 0.93 to 0.7 (indicating a favorable improvement in body composition).[PMID:35658024] In adults with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide also reduced body fat mass by 10% and the proportion of fat mass by 1.4 percentage points. Although lean mass was also reduced by 4%, the proportion of lean mass increased by 1.2 percentage points, and the ratio of fat mass to lean mass decreased.[PMID:31897524] Semaglutide also reduced visceral fat while preserving fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass in adults with type 2 diabetes,[reference|title=Oral semaglutide improves body composition and preserves lean mass in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week prospective real-life study|authors=Volpe et al.|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|published=2023] and in a 24-week retrospective study of adults taking once-weekly semaglutide, body fat decreased while whole-body lean mass and *appendicular skeletal muscle mass* (ASMI, the total mass of arm and leg muscles) were preserved.[PMID:37575352]Thus, recent clinical data don’t seem alarming regarding the impact of weight-loss drugs on lean mass.

The breasts can feel firm, tender, tight, painful, warm, and even lumpy. They will look larger, can be uneven or lopsided, and the skin covering them may appear shiny (due to being stretched) and have more visible veins. The swelling sometimes extends to the armpit or across the sternum and can also affect the nipples, making them firm and flat (or even inverted).[PMID:15326430] Systemically, a mildly elevated body temperature may be present.[PMID:31309696] These signs and symptoms can ebb and flow, remain constant, or progressively worsen with time.[PMID:7619261] It is considered normal to experience some degree of breast engorgement in the first week after giving birth.[PMID:27070206]",

Medical management usually isn’t required, especially for self-limiting cases of primary engorgement. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can be taken at the appropriate dose to reduce symptoms and improve comfort.

[Sunflower lecithin](https://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/lecithin/) is commonly used in the context of breast engorgement to prevent clogged milk ducts by making breast milk “less sticky”. However, there are no controlled trials to support this claim. Similarly, probiotics, specifically *Lactobacillus salivarius* and *Lactobacillus fermentum*, are sometimes used during breast engorgement to prevent mastitis, but high-quality evidence for this practice does not yet exist.[PMID:32146088][PMID:32987448]",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2322/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1120/edit,Breast Engorgement,Are there any other treatments for breast engorgement?,"Frequent (but not excessive) removal of breast milk is the primary treatment for breast engorgement, which means either the infant or a pump must effectively drain milk from the breasts. If breastfeeding, there are some simple techniques to help an infant achieve better feeds from an engorged breast and thus treat the condition. Manual expression of small amounts of milk prior to beginning a feed can soften the breast and help the infant latch onto the nipple more easily. Just remember to keep the amount of expressed milk small because overstimulation will worsen the problem. Reverse pressure softening, pressing into the chest wall with 2 fingers on each side of the nipple, can also help an infant latch on by pushing fluid away from the nipple. If the engorgement is causing a strong let down (ejection of milk), breastfeeding in a reclined position can slow the flow of milk and improve infant feeding.[PMID:27070206][PMID:31309696] Comfort measures are another important aspect of treating breast engorgement. One of the most common methods of reducing pain from engorgement is the use of cold compresses for 15 to 20 minutes between feedings. The compress can be an ice pack, a bag of frozen vegetables, cabbage leaves, or an herbal compress.[PMID:32944940] Heat, applied via a warm shower or warm pack, is sometimes used to facilitate milk removal; however, heat should be limited to only a few minutes immediately prior to a feeding because heat increases blood flow and can worsen breast swelling. Breast massage, acupuncture, and ultrasound therapies have also been used to treat breast engorgement, but there is limited evidence on their efficacy. Of the three methods, gentle massage is the most promising for symptom relief.[PMID:27070206] Additionally, wearing a well-fitting bra that is supportive but not overly tight can reduce discomfort.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2323/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1120/edit,Breast Engorgement,What causes breast engorgement?,"Primary breast engorgement is caused by hormonal shifts that cue the production of copious amounts of milk, and these shifts are called lactogenesis II or the second stage of milk production. During this stage, there is a rapid drop in progesterone and a rise in prolactin, cortisol, and insulin, which stimulate breast milk to “come in” and replace colostrum (the “first milk”).[PMID:18027076] This sudden increase in milk production and interstitial fluid volume causes breast swelling and the signs and symptoms of engorgement. When no complications are present and feeding techniques are effective, it is a self-limiting condition that resolves within the first week postpartum as milk production regulates to match infant demand.[PMID:32944940]Secondary breast engorgement occurs later in the postpartum period when there is a mismatch between milk production and milk removal.[PMID:31309696] There are a wide variety of reasons why this might happen, some related to the lactating parent, some to the infant, and some to both. Examples include a hormonal imbalance in the parent that increases milk production (like hyperthyroidism), pumping too frequently and stimulating excessive milk production, breastfeeding difficulties (like poor latch or positioning), and decreased infant feeding (maybe due to weaning, an infant sickness, or the infant sleeping for longer periods of time at night). Identifying the underlying issue is integral to finding the appropriate treatment.[PMID:32031417]",

A lactation consultant can assess breastfeeding or pumping technique and provide individualized strategies to better manage (and prevent future) engorgement. It is also important to contact a healthcare provider if the engorgement is not getting better despite treatment, if the infant is unable to latch or isn’t making enough wet diapers, if symptoms of mastitis are present (like a fever and body aches), or if there are additional concerns.[PMID:31309696]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2325/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1120/edit,Breast Engorgement,Does breast engorgement affect the infant?,"Breast engorgement can affect the infant. Swollen breasts make latching onto the nipple difficult for infants, especially when the swelling involves the nipple and pulls it inward.[PMID:30215910] This can affect an infant’s willingness to breastfeed, as well as the amount of milk they receive. It can also contribute to nipple pain because the latch that is achieved is often shallow. When breast engorgement is caused by an oversupply of milk, infants can get too much milk too quickly. This can lead to frequent spit ups, lactose overload, explosive green stools, gassiness, fussiness, and coughing/choking at the breast.",

Rather than assessing infant latch and feeding positions, [pumping parents](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/breastfeeding/pumping-breast-milk.html) should assess the appropriateness of their pumping schedule (including frequency and duration of sessions per day) based on their infant’s age and needs and the condition and function of their pump and pump parts.[PMID:26914013] The pump should be providing adequate suction, the flanges should be the proper size, and all the pump parts should be replaced in accordance with the pump manufacturer’s guidelines or as needed. People who pump more frequently need to replace parts more often to maintain optimal suction. Certain pumps also have different suction settings that can be adjusted throughout or between sessions to remove milk more effectively.[PMID:31855456] Some people experiment with these settings until they find a strategy that works best for them.

Nonetheless, there are some strategies that may reduce the risk of developing engorged breasts or the engorgement severity. For primary engorgement, early skin-to-skin contact, which involves placing the dry, naked newborn baby onto the parent’s bare chest shortly after delivery and ideally until the end of the first breastfeeding, is associated with less breast engorgement and breast pain, as is early and effective breastfeeding.[PMID:27885658] Parents who receive thorough breastfeeding education might also be less likely to experience primary engorgement, although the evidence on this intervention is mixed.[PMID:34229526][PMID:27070206]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2330/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1120/edit,Breast Engorgement,Are there ways to prevent secondary breast engorgement?,"For secondary engorgement, prevention involves avoiding a mismatch between milk supply and milk removal. Some strategies include not skipping feeding/pumping sessions, using proper breastfeeding or pumping techniques (e.g., ensuring a good latch, using the proper sized flange), feeding the baby on demand, avoiding breast pumping or expressing milk beyond the infant’s needs, wearing supportive but not overly tight bras, and dropping feeds slowly and gradually rather than abruptly when weaning the infant. If a parent and infant are having feeding difficulties, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider, preferably a lactation consultant.[PMID:27070206] There are also certain breastfeeding techniques that may reduce the likelihood of engorgement. For example, people with an oversupply of milk may benefit from “block feeding”, in which the infant is fed from one breast for a set amount of time (maybe the first 3 to 6 hours of the day) before switching to the other breast for a set amount of time. By reducing stimulation to only one breast per feeding, breast milk production slows down, and engorgement is less likely.[PMID:32031417][PMID:7488804] Techniques like these are best used under the guidance of a lactation consultant or other qualified healthcare professional because they are not appropriate in every situation.",

Doses of 2000 mg daily have been taken for up to 14 days with no adverse effects.[PMID:36482258] Long-term safety of chronic and/or higher doses of NMN hasn’t been tested. It is also important to note that more research is needed to better-understand the effects of boosting NAD+ in certain contexts. For example, by elevating cellular NAD+ levels, NMN could potentially exacerbate chronic inflammation by increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from senescent cells.[PMID: 30778219] It is important to note, however, that NMN-induced inflammation has not been observed in human trials to date.",

Initial NMN trials in humans tested doses of up to 500 mg NMN daily, with no adverse effects; more recent human trials have tested doses approaching 1000 mg/day. However, in mice NMN is typically administered in doses of up to 500 mg/kg daily, which, taking into account the more rapid turnover of NMN in mice than in humans, may be roughly equivalent to a 75 kg human taking 3,000 mg NMN per day.[PMID:29249689]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2337/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/795/edit,Nicotinamide Mononucleotide,How does NAD+ function as an enzyme cofactor?,"Enzymes are simply proteins that are folded into a configuration that allows them to bind other molecules and compounds, catalyzing chemical reactions. Often they can’t accomplish this catalysis alone—many enzymes also require cofactors (aka coenzymes) to function. The way that NAD+ functions as an enzyme cofactor depends on the enzyme. First, NAD+ helps to catalyze ‘redox’ (reduction-oxidation) reactions by accepting electrons from other compounds and molecules, becoming *reduced* (gaining electrons) in the process and forming the compound NADH. The reduction of NAD+ to NADH is critical for a number of enzymes and pathways associated with metabolic regulation and energy homeostasis.Second, some enzymes consume NAD+ in the course of carrying out their catalytic function, converting NAD+ into other forms. In many cases, NAD+-consuming enzymes convert NMN to nicotinamide, which can later be recycled back to NMN. Some examples are the class of enzymes known as sirtuins, which have anti-aging activity,[PMID: 24786309] and *poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases* (PARPs), which help to repair DNA damage.",

The first one is reduced biosynthesis—the older we get, the less NAD+ is produced by the body, possibly due to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.[PMID:35499054] The second mechanism is thought to be increased NAD+ consumption. Increased activity of NAD+-dependent enzymes, coupled with a decreased total pool of available NAD+, creates a situation where there’s not enough NAD+ to support maximal function of the dependent enzymes. For example, DNA damage tends to increase during aging, causing PARP enzymes to consume more NAD+, leaving less of this cofactor available to support the function of other enzymes, such as the sirtuins.",

More specifically, creatine increases calcium *reuptake* into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a structure in muscle cells that stores calcium) and *reduces* muscle relaxation time, whereas caffeine increases calcium *release* from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and *increases* muscle relaxation time.[PMID:11796658] Theoretically, reduced muscle relaxation time would be conducive to generating high amounts of force quickly and in rapid succession. Another potential explanation is that co-ingestion of creatine and caffeine may cause gastrointestinal distress.[PMID:26219105][PMID:26439785]With the above said, some studies have found that *after* 5–6 days of creatine loading, supplementation with caffeine before an exercise test *enhanced* exercise performance.[PMID:12439084][PMID:21207054] Moreover, another study found no differences between supplementation with creatine, creatine plus 300 mg caffeine anhydrous, and creatine plus coffee for changes in strength, muscular endurance, or repeated sprint performance.[PMID:26439785] That said, although caffeine didn’t appear to blunt creatine’s effects in this study, creatine also didn’t appear to have any beneficial effects to begin with. Additionally, studies that have investigated the acute and chronic effects of supplementation with multi-ingredient preworkout supplements containing both caffeine and creatine have reported enhanced exercise performance and muscular adaptations.[PMID:24149870][PMID:24916558][PMID:23153110][PMID:24107586] However, the preworkout supplements also contained ergogenic ingredients other than creatine and caffeine (e.g., [beta-alanine]), which may have confounded the results.Overall, the evidence suggesting that caffeine may blunt creatine’s performance-enhancing effects is weak and observed mainly in studies that implemented a creatine loading protocol or used high (5 mg/kg of bodyweight) doses of caffeine. This implies that this effect — if it exists at all — may not be relevant when creatine loading is not used or when lower doses of caffeine are taken. Until more research is available, it may be best to take caffeine *after* a creatine loading protocol has been completed, take lower (≤3 mg per kg of bodyweight) doses of caffeine when co-ingested with creatine, or simply take creatine and caffeine separately.",

Creatine anhydrous (anhydrous coming from the Greek “an-” meaning “without”, and “hydor” meaning “water”) is just creatine without the monohydrate. Creatine anhydrous is converted to creatine monohydrate when exposed to water.[PMID:15555902][PMID:16274970] Because it does not contain monohydrate, creatine anhydrous is 100% creatine by weight, whereas creatine monohydrate is 88% creatine and 12% monohydrate by weight.Micronized creatine monohydrate is creatine monohydrate that undergoes a mechanical process that reduces the particle size and increases the water solubility of creatine.Other creatine formulations include:- Creatine hydrochloride (Creatine HCl): This form is characterized by the creatine molecules being bound with hydrochloric acid. Creatine HCl is touted to require a lower dosage. However, this claim has not been scientifically proven and seems unlikely, since the stomach has an abundance of HCl anyway, and creatine will separate from HCl in the stomach. Thus, both creatine HCl and creatine monohydrate form free creatine in the stomach.- Liquid creatine: This form has been found to be less effective than creatine monohydrate.[PMID:16287365] The reduced effect is likely due to the passive breakdown of creatine over a period of days into creatinine, which occurs when creatine is suspended in solution.[PMID:15142023] This is not an issue for people preparing a creatine solution at home, since it takes a few days for creatine to start degrading into creatinine.- Buffered creatine (Kre-Alkalyn): This form of creatine has a higher pH level than creatine monohydrate. This is accomplished by adding alkaline powder to creatine. Buffered creatine is touted to enhance the effects of creatine monohydrate. However, this claim has not been scientifically proven. In fact, a 2012 study comparing buffered creatine to creatine monohydrate in 36 resistance-trained individuals found no significant differences between the two with regard to the accumulation of creatine in muscle tissue, training adaptations, or adverse effects.[PMID:22971354]- Creatine ethyl ester: This is an esterified form of creatine monohydrate that has been found to be less effective than creatine monohydrate for increasing muscle creatine levels and enhancing resistance training adaptations.[PMID:19228401]- Magnesium-chelated creatine: In this form of creatine, magnesium ions are attached to the creatine molecules.

This potential benefit of creatine taken in close proximity to the workout, relative to other times, may be related to an upregulation of creatine transport secondary to muscle contraction.[PMID:10444618]A handful of trials have also looked at the effect of supplementation with creatine before compared to after the workout.[PMID:23919405][PMID:24392772][PMID:25993883][PMID:34610729][PMID:36465581] In these trials, no differences were observed between groups for changes in body composition or strength.In summary, because only one trial examined the effect of taking creatine (together with protein and carbohydrate) in close proximity to, compared to further away from, resistance training sessions, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal time to supplement with creatine.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2386/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/361/edit,Berberine,How does berberine reduce blood sugar?,"Broadly speaking, berberine supplementation results in the activation of enzymes responsible for regulating (among other things) energy usage in the body. Most notably, berberine activates AMPK, PKC, and SIRT 1.[PMID:32335802]In animal models, berberine supplementation results in the activation of AMPK.[PMID:20423742] When active, AMPK interacts with a variety of enzymes to suppress anabolic processes (i.e., storing energy and building tissue) and promote catabolism (i.e., breaking down the aforementioned tissue and utilizing glucose for energy).[PMID:27416781] As well as increasing the activity of the glycolytic pathway, AMPK also improves glucose uptake by cells by encouraging glucose transport proteins to migrate to the cell membrane, which increases the rate at which glucose exits the blood and enters the cells (where it is broken down).[PMID:30691068]Relatedly, berberine also results in the activation of PKC. Like AMPK, PKC has a variety of regulatory functions, but most importantly (in this case) it regulates the expression of insulin receptor genes. When activated, PKC increases the rate at which these genes are transcribed and translated into proteins, thereby increasing the number of insulin receptors on cell membranes.[PMID:19059538] Insulin is required to transport glucose into muscle and fat cells, so this PKC-dependent upregulation of insulin receptors can be said to make these cells more “insulin-sensitive”, meaning that less insulin must be released by the pancreas to effectively move glucose from the blood into cells.Berberine can also improve insulin sensitivity through its effects on another regulatory enzyme, SIRT1. SIRT1 is one of several sirtuins present in mammals and helps regulate apoptosis (programmed cell death), mitochondrial function, and inflammation. One animal study found that berberine’s activation of SIRT1 helps improve mitochondrial function (in part by increasing the synthesis of mitochondria) and consequently lowers blood sugar and reduces obesity in rats fed a high-fat diet.[PMID:22027215]",

While it doesn’t increase expression of LDLR, it does increase the stability of the mRNA transcripts that go on to become LDLR proteins, which increases the abundance of LDLR receptors in cells and increases the rate at which they remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.[PMID:15531889] Additionally, berberine also lowers cholesterol by interfering with its absorption in intestines and its release into the blood.[PMID:25002181]One noteworthy thing that berberine *doesn’t* do is interfere with cholesterol synthesis in the body. This contrasts with the most common class of cholesterol-lowering medications, statins, which directly inhibit the rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase.[PMID:15531889] Because its mechanism of action is distinct from that of statins, it means berberine has potential to be useful either in conjunction with, or as a replacement for, statins.

There are three main models of body composition:[PMID:33806245]- A 4-compartment model divides the body’s mass into total body water, bone mineral content, fat mass, and fat-free mass.- A 3-compartment model (e.g., [glossary:DXA-DEXA|dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]) divides the body’s mass into bone mineral content, fat mass, and fat-free mass. - A 2-compartment model (e.g., hydrodensitometry or underwater weighing, air displacement plethysmography, bioelectrical impedance analysis) divides the body’s mass into fat mass and [lean mass|fat-free mass].The 4-compartment model is considered the gold standard, but it requires a variety of equipment and is costly and time-consuming, so it’s not commonly used.",

For example, recent food and fluid intake, supplemental creatine, physical activity, and cold water immersion can all affect DXA estimates of fat mass and *[lean mass|fat-free mass]* (FFM).[PMID:24458265][PMID:28382898][PMID:28410328][PMID:22895377][PMID:22179140]To illustrate the magnitude of effect that the acute manipulation of some of these variables can have on body composition data, consider the reported changes in FFM over a 3-day period in a  combat sport athlete making weight for competition.[PMID:33105389] Body composition was assessed after a 12-hour overnight fast on each day.On the day before their weigh-in (day 1), the individual ingested one meal containing 300 kcal alongside 500 mL of fluid, and they utilized a sauna to promote further body water loss. On day 2, they weighed in for their competition. On the day after their weigh-in (day 3), they consumed food and fluid *ad libitum*. These practices resulted in a reported FFM of 53.0 kilograms on day 1, 50.9 kilograms on day 2, and 56 kilograms on day 3. This corresponds to approximately a 4% change in FFM between days 1 and 2 and a 10% change between days 2 and 3.  Given the fact that it’s physiologically impossible for skeletal muscle and organ mass to undergo significant changes over such a short timespan, these data highlight how influential changes in glycogen and body water can be on DXA measurements.As such, a strict standardized protocol for the use of DXA is necessary to make the most of the data it provides.[PMID:29754949] Scans should be performed:-  By the same skilled technician, on the same scanner, using the same software and reference database- In minimal, lightweight clothing- In a glycogen replete and hydrated state- After abstaining from intense exercise and alcohol for at least 24 hours- In an overnight-fasted and rested state, including abstaining from fluid intake upon waking- After voiding the bladderTo track changes in body composition over time, scans should be taken at least 8 weeks apart.[PMID:29754949] Moreover, similar nutrition and training practices should be followed in the 24 hours prior to each scan.

However, an energy deficit *did not* impair strength gains; interventions that prescribed resistance training with and without an energy deficit both resulted in a significant increase in muscle strength. The average energy deficit in these studies was 567 kcal per day.A caveat to these findings is that the studies included in the above meta-analysis were between 3 and 28 weeks long, with an average intervention duration of 16 weeks.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2400/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Does the source of protein matter for increasing muscle size and strength?,"Plant-based proteins are thought to be inferior to animal-based proteins because (i) they generally contain lower amounts of *[essential amino acid]s* overall; (ii) they often contain an inadequate amount of one or more specific EAAs (typically [lysine], methionine, and/or [leucine]), and a sufficient amount of all EAA are needed to sustain *[muscle protein synthesis]* (MPS); and (iii) they are generally less digestible, meaning that a lower amount of EAA are available for muscle tissue after consuming plant-based proteins.[PMID:34200501]There are ways around these issues, however. For starters, while whole food sources of plant-based proteins are generally less digestible than whole food sources of animal-based protein sources, this does not appear to be the case for protein powders.[PMID:34515966]Second, it’s possible to compensate for lower amounts of EAA simply by consuming a larger amount of plant-based protein. Research indicates that when a dose of 30 grams of a plant-based protein powder is consumed — regardless of whether it’s derived from wheat, potato, corn, pea, or a combination of sources — a rise in MPS is achieved that is comparable to that of milk protein.[PMID:33597056][PMID:35438672][PMID:36170964][reference|url=https://academic.oup.com/cdn/article/4/Supplement_2/651/5845124|title=The Muscle Protein Synthetic Response Following Ingestion of Corn Protein, Milk Protein and Their Protein Blend in Young Males|authors=Pinckaers et al|journal=Current Developments in Nutrition|published=06-2020] Similar results were also reported in a study that compared chicken breast to a lysine-enriched meat alternative composed of wheat and chickpea protein.[PMID:34881688]Moreover, most of us don’t consume a single isolated protein source. From a whole diet perspective, protein intake is typically derived from a variety of foods. Finally, it’s important to consider the elephant in the room here: acute increases in MPS aren’t necessarily predictive of longer term muscle gains,[PMID:34697259] and the accumulation of muscle mass occurs over a weeks-to-months timescale, rather than minutes-to-hours. So, it’s prudent to question the model used to assess differences in the “muscle-building ability” of plant- and animal-based proteins. This brings us to the central question of importance: can vegan and omnivorous diets similarly support resistance exercise-induced adaptations?The answer seems to be yes. In two separate studies in young adults that included a resistance exercise intervention and randomized the participants to consume a high-protein diet (≥1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day), either mostly from animal-based proteins or exclusively from plant-based proteins, both found comparable increases in muscle size and strength between groups after a few months.[PMID:36822394][PMID:33599941]In sum, the collective evidence suggests that as long as total daily protein intake is sufficiently high and a variety of plant-based proteins are consumed, vegan and omnivorous diets are equally effective for increasing muscle size and strength.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2401/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Does the distribution of protein intake throughout the day matter?,"The available research indicates that a total daily protein intake of 1.6–2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day is best to maximize gains in muscle size and strength. But how should one go about consuming this much protein? It appears that multiple protein feedings per day may be best, based on a few lines of evidence.[*Muscle protein synthesis*] (MPS) is a saturable process; that is, ingesting a certain amount of protein at a meal produces a maximal MPS response and ingesting more protein will not further increase MPS. Protein-feeding studies using various doses of whey protein indicate that about 0.24 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, on average, maximizes the MPS response in young adults, while a dose of 0.40 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, on average, maximizes the MPS response in older adults.[PMID:25056502] In addition, the rise in MPS following protein ingestion is transient, and MPS reverts to baseline levels after a few hours.[PMID:20844073][PMID:22451437] Corresponding with these data, it’s been shown that ingesting 20 grams of whey protein every 3 hours is more effective at stimulating MPS over a 12-hour period than ingesting 10 grams of protein every 1.5 hours or 40 grams of protein every 6 hours.[PMID:23459753] In similar studies that had two groups consume diets with equivalent amounts of protein but different distribution patterns, one found greater 24-hour MPS rates with a diet that provided 30–33 grams of protein at each main meal, compared to a diet that provided 11, 16, and 63 grams of protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively;[PMID:24477298] while the second found that a protein distribution of 0.33, 0.46, and 0.48 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively, was slightly better for increasing lean mass over 12 weeks than a distribution of 0.12, 0.45, and 0.83 grams per kilogram of body weight at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively.[PMID:32321161]Because muscle gain is ultimately dependent on rates of MPS exceeding rates of muscle protein breakdown *over time* (see “How does muscle gain occur?” under “What is muscle size and strength?”), it follows that multiple maximal MPS responses per day would be beneficial for muscle gain. This relationship seems to reach a point of diminishing returns, however, as one study in rugby players found no difference between six and four protein feedings per day for increasing lean mass.[PMID: 26132746] However, weighing the collective evidence, it’s reasonable to assume that three to four protein feedings per day is superior to one. Therefore, in the context of a total daily protein intake of 1.6–2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, it’s recommended that individuals consume 0.40–0.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight across roughly four meals per day.[PMID:29497353]",

However, this relationship appears to be influenced by load. When using light loads (30%–40% of 1-repetition maximum), sets should be performed to failure to maximize muscle gain,[PMID:37171517] but as the load gets heavier, training to failure becomes less important.[PMID:38970765] Further research on the relationship between load, proximity to failure, and muscle gain is needed, but evidence suggests that in the context of heavy loads (≥80% of 1-repetition maximum), training to failure and stopping a set several reps shy of failure produce similar muscle gain.[reference|url=https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/295/version/383|title=Exploring the Dose-Response Relationship Between Estimated Resistance Training Proximity to Failure, Strength Gain, and Muscle Hypertrophy: A Series of Meta-Regressions|authors=Robinson et al|journal=SportRxiv|published=2023-05]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2403/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Why would keeping a few reps in the tank be better than training to muscular failure for strength gains?,"An increasingly common way to prescribe resistance exercise is to use a velocity loss threshold (VLT). The performance of resistance exercise according to a VLT means that once a certain percentage of velocity loss from the fastest repetition (typically the first) of a set is obtained, the set is terminated. For example, a VLT of 25% would mean that the individual stops performing repetitions once they complete a rep that has a velocity 25% slower than the fastest repetition. Consequently, a lower VLT typically means sets are completed further away from muscular failure than sets with a higher VLT. Evidence suggests that VLTs ≤ 25% are superior to greater VLTs for increasing strength.[PMID: 35038063][reference|url=https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv/v3tr9/|title=The effects of different intra-set velocity loss thresholds on lower-limb adaptations to resistance training in young adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis|authors=Gantois et al|journal=SportRxiv Preprints|published=2021-06] Why might that be the case? One hypothesis for the superior effects of lower VLTs is mitigating muscle damage.[PMID: 35038063]Training to muscular failure produces greater muscle damage and neuromuscular fatigue than ending sets a few reps shy of muscular failure.[PMID:30036284][PMID:28965198][PMID:30836680] Muscle damage negatively affects the recruitment of high-threshold motor units and the ability of muscles to produce force,[PMID:30036284] as well as motor skill learning.[PMID:31362262] It also delays recovery from exercise, which can lead to a reduction in training frequency and less exposure to the exercise(s) on which the individual is interested in increasing strength. Therefore, training to muscular failure can compromise increases in muscle strength, particularly for complex movement patterns, by impairing training quality.[PMID:35038063] By training with a lower VLT, an individual can lift heavy loads (≥ 80% of 1-repetition maximum—the most important factor for increasing strength) and practice the exercise of interest more often.Another hypothesis is that training with lower VLTs preserves maximum force-generating capacity through its effects on muscle fiber-type distribution.[PMID:35038063] One 8-week study found that training with a 40% VLT produced a reduction in the proportion of type IIX muscle fibers (the fastest and most powerful muscle fiber type) compared to a 20% VLT.[PMID:27038416] Because type II muscle fibers possess a higher force-generating capacity and generate force more rapidly than type I muscle fibers, training regimens that retain or increase the proportion of type II muscle fibers are theoretically superior for strength adaptations.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2404/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,What’s the best way to track training over time?,"Training volume refers to the total amount of work carried out in a single training session, which can be summed over weeks or months of training. Evidence indicates that volume is a major driver of muscle gain,[PMID:35291645] and thus, tracking training volume can be important to ensure the dose of training is sufficient to facilitate positive adaptations, without reaching a point of diminishing returns and overtraining.There are many different ways to track volume. Volume load (i.e., sets multiplied by repetitions multiplied by weight load) is a popular and adequate method. However, it falls short in protocols that utilize sets of very high repetitions (e.g., 25–30 repetitions per set). In these protocols, volume load can be especially high, but muscle gain is no greater than that achieved with the same number of sets performed using a higher load and a lower number of repetitions.[PMID:33671664] Another shortcoming of volume load becomes apparent when comparing different exercises. For example, using the same number of sets and repetitions, volume load will virtually always be higher for a leg press than a leg extension, but a leg press will not necessarily produce greater quadriceps hypertrophy.A reliable method to quantify training volume implies similar muscle gain at matched training volumes, independent of other training variables. Evidence suggests that counting the total number of hard sets (i.e., sets performed within four repetitions of muscular failure) when the repetition range lies between about 6 and 30 repetitions fulfills this criterion.[PMID:30063555]As discussed in the FAQ below, “Are heavy or light weights better for muscle gain?”, beyond 20 repetitions or so, a set should probably only be counted as a “hard set” if it is performed to muscular failure.However, when trying to quantify training volume between a program that consists of low-repetition sets (i.e., <5 repetitions per set) and a program that consists of moderate-repetition sets (i.e., 8–12 repetitions per set), it seems best to use volume load.[PMID:30063555] Some evidence indicates that, when equated for total number of sets, moderate loads (8–12 repetition maximum) are superior to very heavy loads (2–4 repetition maximum) for muscle gain.[PMID:27928218] In contrast, when moderate loads and very heavy loads are equated for volume load, no differences in muscle gain have been observed between groups.[PMID:24714538][PMID:27218448][PMID:32304514]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2405/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Tracking sets: should multi-joint and single-joint exercises be counted equally?,"In exercise science research, muscle groups deemed prime movers during multi-joint and single-joint exercises are classified the same from a set standpoint.[PMID:31336594] For example, one set of a lat pulldown is counted as one set when considering biceps brachii hypertrophy, and the same goes for one set of bench press when considering triceps brachii hypertrophy. Similarly, one set of a barbell back squat and one set of leg extensions are both counted as one set when examining quadriceps hypertrophy, although in the former, other muscles such as the gluteus maximus are heavily involved.This information is critical for interpreting the results of meta-analyses on the relationship between volume and muscle hypertrophy, particularly for the limb muscles. One meta-analysis found that around 12–20 sets per muscle group per week is optimal for muscle growth; however, that should not be interpreted to mean 12–20 sets of single-joint biceps or triceps movements should be performed to maximize the growth of these muscle groups.[PMID:35291645]  Rather, based on the studies included in the meta-analysis and how these studies calculated training volume, this set range implies a myriad of possible combinations of single-joint and multi-joint exercises (e.g., five sets of biceps curls, five sets of lat pulldowns, and five sets of cable rows, totaling 15 sets for the biceps per week).There are good reasons, both biomechanically and physiologically, to suggest that single-joint exercises may be more effective for hypertrophy of the limb muscles than multi-joint exercises,[PMID:31268995][PMID:32149887] and as such, one set of an upper-body multi-joint exercise should count less toward the volume for the limb muscles than one set of a single-joint exercise. However, it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise amount of volume that should be assigned to multi-joint exercises due to differences in exercise selection (e.g., narrow vs. wide grip), training experience, and anatomical structure and mobility (which influences range of motion about a given joint and thus muscle activation).[PMID:33826122]As a general rule of thumb, one set of a multi-joint press (i.e., bench press or shoulder press) can be counted as half a set for the triceps,[PMID:32149887][PMID:24265879][reference|url=https://www.scielo.br/j/motriz/a/jbfGfJrRsXbfc9BrfXgVSPy/?lang=en|title=Comparison of electromyographic activity during the bench press and barbell pullover exercises|journal=Motriz: Revista de Educacao Fisica|published=2014-04][reference|url=https://www.scielo.br/j/rbme/a/wZB7qVqH98pXGzH9p4kyg5Q/?lang=en|title=Comparison among the EMG activity of the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids and triceps brachii during the bench press and peck deck exercises|journal=Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|published=2007-02] and the same can be said for a multi-joint pull (i.e., row or pulldown) and the biceps.[PMID: 31268995][PMID:15228624][PMID:20543740]Whether an individual chooses to count one set of an upper-body multi-joint exercise as one set or half a set toward the limb muscles is less important than being consistent with the method used to quantify training volume, although the latter may be more accurate in terms of the stimulus the limb muscles are receiving.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2406/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,How often should I train to maximize gains in muscle size and strength?,"For muscle gain, each muscle group should be trained at least once per week. The available evidence generally does not indicate a benefit to higher training frequencies,[PMID:30558493] particularly when volume is equated between interventions. However, it seems likely that when weekly training volume exceeds 10 sets per week, a higher training frequency would be advantageous, as opposed to performing 10+ sets for a muscle group in a single session.[reference|url=https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/81|title=Resistance Training Recommendations to Maximize Muscle Hypertrophy in an Athletic Population: Position Stand of the IUSCA|authors=Schoenfeld et al|journal=International Journal of Strength and Conditioning|published=2021-08]For strength, training frequency can be conceptualized as the number of times per week an exercise is performed, as strength is ultimately specific to the test being used to assess it. In accordance with the data on muscle gain, there does not appear to be an advantage to training frequencies of more than once per week in the context of volume-equated training programs.[PMID:30076500][PMID: 29470825]It’s important to highlight that the above data represents the average response, which may not apply to the reader, as the response to a given training frequency can radically differ between individuals. In one study that had participants perform high-frequency (5x per week) resistance exercise with one leg and low frequency (2x or 3x per week) resistance exercise with the other leg, it was found that some individuals gained more muscle and strength on the leg assigned to the high-frequency condition and some individuals gained more muscle and strength on the leg assigned to the low-frequency condition, while others experienced no difference between conditions.[PMID:30289872] Furthermore, only about 32% of individuals displayed an aligned response, i.e., the same resistance training frequency was better for both muscle gain and strength. Therefore, it’s prudent that the individuals experiment with different training frequencies to find what works best for them for increasing muscle size and strength.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2407/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,"If I have limited time to exercise, how should I structure my training to increase muscle size and strength?","A handful of studies have demonstrated that workouts consisting of 1 set per exercise performed 2–3 times per week can significantly increase muscle size and strength,[PMID:9777681][PMID:10647555] albeit the increase is less than it would be if more work was performed, especially in the context of muscle gain. According to a 2017 meta-analysis, performing <5 sets per muscle group per week produced muscle gain, but the percentage increase (5.4%) was less than that of 5–9 sets (6.6%) and 10+ (9.8%) sets per week.[PMID:27433992]Even those with a bit of resistance training experience under their belt can make meaningful — but suboptimal — progress with a relatively low dose of exercise. According to a meta-analysis published in 2020,[PMID:31797219] performing a single set of 6–12 repetitions to failure with a load of 70%–85% of *1-repetition maximum* (1RM) two to three times per week for 8–12 weeks can increase squat and bench press 1RM by about 17.5 and 8.25 kilograms, respectively, in individuals with at least one year of training experience.There is also evidence in powerlifters demonstrating that relatively small amounts of work can significantly increase strength. According to a study consisting of multiple experiments published in 2021,[PMID:34527944] a program with the following characteristics can promote meaningful increases in 1RM strength on the powerlifts (i.e., the barbell back squat, bench press, and deadlift) over 6–12 weeks:- Volume: 3–6 sets of 1–5 repetitions per week- Load: ≥ 80% of 1RM- Frequency: 1–3 sessions per week- Proximity to failure: 1–4 repetitions shy of failure Some people may be okay with doing the bare-bones amount of resistance exercise necessary to make some semblance of progress in muscle size and strength, but what about those with more serious goals? Are they doomed to suboptimal gains due to their lack of time? Not necessarily.There are ways to structure a workout to reduce the amount of time spent in the gym without leaving gains on the table. One strategy is to perform supersets (i.e., sets of two exercises performed in succession, with limited to no rest between them) involving exercises for agonist and antagonist muscles. For example, one study had participants perform the bench press and bench pull (a row) exercises.[PMID:19967584] For 8 weeks, one group took 4 minutes of rest between each set of both exercises, while the other group took 4 minutes of rest between supersets, which resulted in the workouts taking approximately half the time. In the end, increases in 1RM were similar between groups for both exercises.Another strategy is to perform rest-pause sets, which involves performing a set to failure, taking a brief rest (typically 20 seconds), and repeating this cycle until a prespecified number of total repetitions is completed. In a 6-week study, the traditional group performed each exercise for 3 sets of 6 repetitions using 80% of 1RM and rested 2–3 minutes between sets, while the rest-pause group performed an initial set with 80% of 1RM until failure, rested for 20 seconds, and repeated this cycle until they completed a total of 18 repetitions.[PMID:28617715] This resulted in the training sessions lasting around 57 and 35 minutes in the traditional and rest-pause groups, respectively.In the end, increases in 1RM strength did not differ between groups, while the increase in thigh muscle thickness (but not arm or chest thickness) was greater in the rest-pause group. However, this difference was likely due to the fact that the rest-pause group exerted a greater degree of effort during their workouts, as a set of 6 repetitions with 80% of 1RM typically means ending the set a few repetitions shy of muscular failure, and as stated in “Do I need to train to muscular failure?”, there is an advantage to training to failure for muscle gain.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2408/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,What happens if I fall off the gainz train? How much exercise is needed to maintain what I’ve built?,"Skeletal muscle is remarkably plastic and can adapt to an array of circumstances in accordance with the demands imposed upon it. Consequently, consistent, progressive resistance exercise leads to increases in muscle size and strength. But life happens, and sometimes the performance of resistance exercise isn’t so consistent. In fact, it’s quite common for people to take off a few weeks from resistance exercise altogether, whether that be due to obligations outside of the gym, decreased motivation, illness or injury, etc. So, what exactly happens during these periods, and how long does it take for these changes to manifest?While the principle of “use it or lose it” holds true, it ultimately comes down to the amount of time off from resistance exercise. In athletes (powerlifters and division I American football players), 14 days of detraining (i.e., no formal resistance exercise or structured physical activity) led to a nonsignificant reduction of about 2 kilograms in *1-repetition maximum* (1RM) back squat and bench press strength.[PMID:8371654] There was also a nonsignificant 5.2% reduction in vastus lateralis type I muscle fiber area and a significant 6.4% reduction in type II muscle fiber area.In a separate study, in which men with some resistance training experience performed a 4 weeks of a resistance exercise intervention for 4 weeks and then detrained for 2 weeks, there were no changes in rectus femoris cross-sectional area or in total lean mass. Furthermore, the gains in 1RM leg press strength accrued during the training period were maintained.[PMID:28316261]In addition to these findings, which suggest that 1RM strength is relatively robust in men, 6 weeks of detraining in men with some resistance training experience did not significantly reduce 1RM bench press or squat strength.[PMID:12173951]There have also been a couple of studies in untrained men that examined long-term changes in muscle size and strength between a group that continuously performed resistance exercise and a group that cycled through periods of 6 weeks of training and 3 weeks of detraining.[PMID:21771261][PMID:23053130] In these studies, increases in muscle size and strength were similar between groups.Evidently, taking a week (or three) off from the gym doesn’t have much impact on muscle size and strength in men. However, more substantial decreases in muscle size and strength have been reported during detraining periods of 8–12 weeks.[PMID:11474330] This leads to the question: how much work is required to mitigate these adverse effects?In one study that had untrained men perform resistance exercise 3 times per week for 8 weeks and then reduce their training frequency to either once or twice per week and reduce the amount of volume performed by 50%–60%, quadriceps cross-sectional area and half squat 1RM were both maintained.[PMID:28316261]In a second study,[PMID:21131862] younger and older adults (20–35 and 60–75 years old, respectively) underwent 16 weeks of progressive resistance exercise, training the quadriceps 3 days per week. The participants then reduced their training frequency to once per week and reduced their training volume to one-ninth of what was performed during the initial 16-week training program.In younger adults, it was found that the increase in thigh lean mass from the initial 16 weeks of training was maintained throughout the maintenance protocol. In contrast, the initial increase in thigh lean mass was not maintained in older adults (60–75 years old). Notably, a less severe reduction in training volume, one-third of what was performed during the initial 16-week training program, was also insufficient to maintain thigh lean mass in these participants.For strength, knee extension 1RM was significantly higher at the end of the maintenance protocol (week 48) compared to the end of the initial 16-week training period in younger adults, whereas in older adults, the initial increase in knee extension 1RM was maintained throughout the maintenance protocol.As evidenced by the above, younger adults can get away with doing very little resistance exercise for an extended period without experiencing reductions in muscle size or strength, but older adults don’t seem to have the same luxury, at least when it comes to retaining muscle size. In younger adults, the evidence suggests that 1–3 weeks of detraining after several weeks of regular, progressive resistance exercise does not pose a significant risk of muscle and strength loss. Furthermore, reducing training frequency to 1–2 times per week and performing approximately one-ninth of previous training volume may be sufficient to maintain muscle size and strength.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2409/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,How often should I switch up my exercise routine?,"If you’ve spent any appreciable amount of time in the fitness space on social media, you may have come across the term “muscle confusion” — the idea that workouts should be constantly varied in order to provide a novel stimulus and enhance muscular adaptations. Does the science back this idea up?In an 8-week study that had resistance-trained men perform workouts composed of unilateral leg presses and leg extensions,[PMID:31268828] one leg was randomly assigned to perform the same workout each session, while the other leg cycled through 4 different workouts that varied in (i) the number of repetitions performed per set, (ii) the number of sets performed, (iii) the type of contraction (i.e., only eccentric contractions were performed), and (iv) the amount of rest taken between sets.It was found that muscle gain did not differ between interventions. Furthermore, intraindividual analysis indicated that none of the participants experienced greater muscle growth from one intervention than the other.This suggests that frequent variation does not enhance muscle gain. However, as noted in the response to the question of, “Are a variety of exercises necessary to maximize muscle gain?” there is indeed a benefit to including a variety of exercises within a training program. In the aforementioned study, the exercises performed remained constant, while other variables were manipulated. Does frequent variation in exercise selection affect muscle gain?There is very little research examining this question. In the best study currently available, resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to one of two 8-week resistance exercise programs. The control program featured upper-body and lower-body workouts consisting of the same exercises each workout, and the interventional program featured upper-body and lower-body workouts consisting of exercises randomly selected from a database of 80 different exercises each workout.[PMID:31881066]In the end, there were no significant differences between groups for changes in muscle thickness of the individual quadriceps’ muscles. However, it’s worth highlighting that there was a large increase in intrinsic motivation in the group that varied their exercise selection, while there was a nonsignificant decrease in the group that kept exercise constant, which may be important for long-term adherence.While the results suggest that frequent variation in exercise selection does not affect muscle gain, this was a single 8-week study. Over the longer term, however, there may be disadvantages to overdoing the variation. It’s possible that too-frequent variation in exercise selection could impair muscle gain by increasing the difficulty of achieving and quantifying progressive overload (i.e., the gradual increase in stress which, when imposed on the body, facilitates continued adaptations)[PMID:35438660] — the primary stimulus for muscle gain. Also, rotating exercises too frequently may cause excessive fatigue because an unaccustomed stimulus promotes muscle damage.[PMID:12409811] This could lead to a subsequent reduction in training volume and frequency, and thus an impairment in muscle gain.[PMID:35438660]With respect to strength, the story is a bit different. Given the important role of the specificity principle in strength gain,[PMID:36396899][PMID:27380100] it follows that to maximally increase strength for a given exercise, that exercise should be emphasized in the training program and performed in a manner that facilitates improvements in the strength test of interest. For example, in a study that had one group train with a load corresponding to a 3–5 *repetition maximum* (RM) and another group train with a load corresponding to 20–28RM, the former experienced greater increases in 1RM strength, while the latter performed better on a test of repetitions to failure at 60% of 1RM.[PMID:12436270]Further evidence for this stems from the study mentioned above.[PMID:31881066] It was found that absolute changes in 1-repetition maximum bench press strength favored the control group (4.7% vs. 0.77%), which regularly included the bench press in their upper body workouts, while the exercise variation group performed the bench press much less frequently (exactly how much was not specified) due to the nature of their program.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2410/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Are machines as good as free weights?,"It’s been suggested that free weights are better for increasing muscle strength because they require greater degrees of balance and muscle coordination than machine-based exercises.[reference|title=A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING ASSOCIATION’S OPINION THAT FREE WEIGHTS ARE SUPERIOR TO MACHINES FOR INCREASING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND POWER|authors=Carpinelli, RN|published=2017-01] These factors also lead to a greater recruitment of stabilizing muscles during free-weight exercises,[reference|url=https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/81|title=Resistance Training Recommendations to Maximize Muscle Hypertrophy in an Athletic Population: Position Stand of the IUSCA|authors=Schoenfeld et al|journal=International Journal of Strength and Conditioning|published=2021-08]which contributes to the speculation that free weights are also better for muscle gain. Others have postulated that free weights are superior for muscle gain because they produce higher levels of muscle activation[PMID:19855308] and a greater release of anabolic hormones.[PMID:24276305] Contrary to the above hypotheses, the available evidence does not indicate that free weights are *universally* better for increasing strength; rather, free weights are better than machines for increasing free-weight strength, and machines are better than free weights for increasing machine-based strength.[PMID:34609100] Ultimately, the efficacy of either tool is dependent upon how strength is tested.With respect to muscle gain, specifically in terms of the direct muscle group being trained, limited evidence indicates that machines and free weights are equally effective.[PMID:34609100] Furthermore, in a 10-week study that assigned untrained men to perform a resistance exercise program consisting of free weights only, machines only, or free weights only for 5 weeks and machines only for 5 weeks, there were no differences between groups for changes in upper arm, chest, or thigh circumference.[PMID:33114782]It stands to reason that stabilizing muscles would experience greater growth with free weights, although there is a scarcity of research directly examining these. Nevertheless, the best way to grow a specific muscle is to perform an exercise that directly, rather than indirectly, targets it. So, instead of prioritizing the performance of one exercise over another because it stimulates a greater number of muscles due to their role as synergists or stabilizers in the movement, it’s likely better to perform a variety of exercises, each of which directly targets different muscles, to maximize muscle gain. For further evidence in support of this hypothesis, see “Are a variety of exercises necessary to maximize muscle gain?”.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2411/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Are light weights as good as heavy weights for muscle gain?,"Evidence indicates that low (<60% of 1-repetition maximum) and high (≥60% of 1-repetition maximum) loads produce similar muscle gain.[PMID:35015560] However, this notion starts to fall apart at the extremes.Very light loads (15%–20% of 1-repetition maximum) seem to be inferior to higher loads for muscle gain,[PMID:29564973][PMID:31486720] and in order for loads at the lower end of the “hypertrophy repetition continuum” (i.e., 30% of 1-repetition maximum) to be as effective as higher loads, each set must be performed to muscular failure (i.e., the point at which another concentric repetition cannot be performed with proper form).[PMID:31895290][PMID:29189407][PMID:25853914]This is much easier said than done, however. Training with low loads (30%–50% of 1-repetition maximum) to muscular failure tends to produce more discomfort, displeasure, and a higher rating of perceived exertion than training with higher loads.[PMID:28006852][PMID:31499564] As such, not everyone possesses the capacity to reach the point of muscular failure with low loads, making them a suboptimal option for muscle gain for many people.On the other hand, very high loads (i.e., a 2- to 4-repetition maximum) may be inferior to moderate-to-high loads for muscle gain. One study found greater increases in lateral thigh muscle thickness when resistance-trained men performed 3 sets of an 8- to 12-repetition maximum compared to 3 sets of a 2- to 4-repetition maximum.[PMID:27928218] In another study that equated volume load (i.e., load multiplied by repetitions multiplied by sets) between conditions, 7 sets of a 2- to 4-repetition maximum were as effective as 3 sets of an 8- to 12-repetition maximum at increasing biceps muscle thickness. However, the very-high-load group reported high levels of fatigue, both physically and psychologically, and joint-related issues, which was not the case in the moderate-load group.[PMID:24714538]Therefore, in order for very high loads to produce similar muscle gain to moderate-to-high loads, more sets need to be performed, which takes more time to complete and risks inducing a greater strain on connective tissue. From a practical standpoint, training with moderate-to-high loads (i.e., a 5- to 10-repetition maximum) may be the best approach for muscle gain for most people.",

Additionally, UP was only superior to LP in studies featuring trained participants.In contrast, periodized programs were not reported to be superior to nonperiodized programs for muscle gain.[PMID:35044672] It may be the case that the methods used to assess changes in muscle size were not sensitive enough to detect small differences between groups, as a number of the included studies used indirect measures. However, there is good reason, physiologically, to doubt the superiority of periodized programs for muscle gain.Because a variety of loads produce similar muscle gain,[PMID:33671664] and high and low loads do not appear to reliably induce different degrees of type I and type II fiber hypertrophy,[PMID:33312275] there doesn’t seem to be any strong physiological rationale to substantiate how varying training loads across a training program would produce superior muscle growth,[PMID:33312275] at least under ideal conditions. It may be the case that varying training loads increases the individual’s motivation to exercise, fostering greater adherence to the program and increasing the amount of effort they exert during their workouts, which would theoretically enhance muscle gain over the long term.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2413/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,What’s the best lifting tempo?,"Lifting tempo refers to the speed at which the individual *intentionally* lifts and lowers a weight, which is only under control to a certain extent, as the speed of the concentric portion (i.e., the active lifting of the weight, as opposed to the lowering or eccentric portion) will inevitably be slow when lifting a maximal load (e.g., a 1-repetition maximum) or squeezing out the last couple of repetitions during a high-repetition set to failure.There is evidence to suggest that lifting with a very slow tempo on the concentric portion (10 seconds) can impair muscle gain.[PMID:22328004] Another study found that lifting with a faster tempo on the concentric portion (1 second vs. 3 seconds) was better for muscle gain.[PMID:19199198]With respect to the eccentric portion of a repetition, there is evidence to suggest that slower (4 seconds vs. 1 second) is better.[reference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305676699_Resistance_training_with_slow_speed_of_movement_is_better_for_hypertrophy_and_muscle_strength_gains_than_fast_speed_of_movement|title=Resistance training with slow speed of movement is better for hypertrophy and muscle strength gains than fast speed of movement|authors=Pereira et al|journal=International Journal of Applied Exercise Physiology|published=2016-07]The limited evidence available indicates that a slower tempo during the eccentric phase and a faster tempo during the concentric phase is probably beneficial for muscle hypertrophy,[PMID:34043184] but there aren’t strict guidelines that should be adhered to, with the exception of avoiding repetition durations that are intentionally very slow (> 10 seconds per repetition).[PMID:25601394] For the purpose of muscle gain, the individual should strive for a relatively-explosive lifting motion, then lower under control. Further evidence for the lack of a need to focus on a specific lifting tempo stems from a 2020 study that found that lifting with a strict tempo of 2 seconds on the concentric portion and 2 seconds on the eccentric portion was no better than a self-selected lifting tempo for muscle gain.[PMID:32185108]The same recommendation more or less applies for increasing strength: the concentric portion of the repetition should be explosive,[PMID:28105573] and there aren’t strict guidelines that should be adhered to for the eccentric portion, with the exception of avoiding very slow eccentric motions. In two studies that examined the effects of different tempos on the eccentric during a 1-repetition maximum bench press test, slower tempos (4–10 seconds) decreased the amount of load lifted compared to faster tempos (either self-selected or 2 seconds).[PMID:32269656][PMID:32390725] Considering the importance of lifting heavy loads for increasing strength (see “What type of exercise is best for muscle size and strength?”), it’s prudent that those with serious strength goals utilize relatively fast tempos on the eccentric phase to maximize the amount of load they are able to lift.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2414/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1278/edit,Muscle Size & Strength,Which exercise should be performed first in a workout?,"If the goal is to increase strength on a particular exercise, that exercise should unquestionably be performed first in the workout,[PMID:32077380] as performing the exercise in an unfatigued state will allow the individual to lift heavier loads, which is of the utmost importance for maximizing gains in strength.In terms of muscle gain, the overall body of evidence suggests muscle gain does not differ between programs that start workouts with a multi-joint exercise followed by a *single-joint* (SJ) exercise and programs that start workouts with a single-joint exercise followed by a *multi-joint* (MJ) exercise.[PMID:32077380] However, the results of this meta-analysis are limited by the fact that most studies measured changes in muscle size only in the muscle that was the primary agonist in the single-joint exercise, but functioned as a synergist or supporting muscle in the multi-joint exercise. For example, a few studies measured changes in biceps brachii size between a group that performed workouts of a lat pulldown followed by a biceps curl and a group that performed workouts of a biceps curl followed by a lat pulldown. The results indicated that changes in biceps brachii size are similar between groups, but what about changes in latissimus dorsi size? Does regularly performing a biceps curl before a lat pulldown compromise increases in latissimus dorsi size? This question has not been adequately examined, but limited evidence suggests that this may indeed be the case.A 2020 study not included in the aforementioned meta-analysis compared changes in the *cross-sectional area* (CSA) of the pectoralis major in a group that performed workouts consisting of the barbell bench press followed by the lying barbell triceps press (MJ+SJ) and a group that performed workouts consisting of the lying barbell triceps press followed by the barbell bench press (SJ+MJ).[PMID:32149887] Although there was technically no significant difference between groups, pectoralis major growth in SJ+MJ was approximately half that of MJ+SJ (5.6% vs. 10.6%).This result may be due to the fact that the triceps brachii functions as a synergist in the bench press. Thus, performing the lying barbell triceps press first in the workout fatigued the triceps brachii and consequently impaired subsequent bench press performance, reducing the hypertrophic stimulus attained by the pectoralis major.Further research is needed, but the same rule of thumb for strength likely applies to muscle gain: the exercise most important to the primary goal of the training program should be performed first in the workout. For example, if the individual’s primary goal is to increase the size of their chest, they should start their workout with an exercise where the chest muscles are the primary agonist, whether that be a multi-joint (e.g., barbell bench press) or a single-joint exercise (e.g., a machine chest fly).",

St. John's wort typically blooms and is harvested towards the end of June, when St. John's feast day is celebrated. Traditionally, the plant was hung from doors on St. John’s feast day to protect against malevolent spirits and to ensure the well-being of both humans and animals.Hypericin and hyperforin are the two main active metabolites of HP. Additionally, HP contains various other active compounds like [flavonoids], as well as several inactive substances.[PMID:32491397]In *traditional Chinese medicine* (TCM) the extract of HP has been used as a herbal remedy to treat [depression]. It is also recommended for the same purpose in many European countries.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2449/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/146/edit,St. John's Wort,What are the main benefits of St. John’s wort?,"HP appears to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate [depression]. Several studies have investigated its clinical effects by comparing the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of people taking HP to those of people taking a placebo or commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs. Many of these studies have indicated that HP extracts have a similar clinical response and remission rate to *serotonin reuptake inhibitors* (SSRIs), while also having a lower rate of treatment discontinuation due to side effects.[PMID:28064110][PMID:36226689][PMID:15554758]In comparison to *tricyclic antidepressants* (TCAs), HP appears to have fewer side effects and a lower dropout rate during treatment.[PMID:15554758]Furthermore, one *in vitro* study using a specific HP extract (containing only 4 compounds) found that that extract of HP increased neuronal plasticity (the ability of neurons and neural elements to adapt to internal or external stimuli such as chronic stress exposure) and neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons). Additionally, the HP extract exhibited anti-inflammatory properties and protected neurons from cytotoxicity induced by glutamate and *N-methyl-D-aspartate* (NMDA), which is considered a potential factor in depression.[PMID:29403374]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2450/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/146/edit,St. John's Wort,What are the main drawbacks of St. John’s wort?,"Studies have shown that HP can interfere with the expression of enzymes of the *cytochrome-P* (CYP) family[PMID:25032007] and of *P-glycoprotein*, both of which play a role in the metabolism of various medications. This can result in altered effects of certain drugs, potentially leading to reduced effectiveness or unexpected outcomes. Common medications whose effect may be decreased by HP include some oral contraceptive pills, warfarin (an anticoagulant drug), cyclosporin (often used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplants),[PMID:12580993] digoxin (mostly used for atrial fibrillation), proton pump inhibitors (used to reduce stomach acid production), and some statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs).[PMID:28064110][PMID:11849198]Furthermore, combining HP with other antidepressants that increase serotonin levels (e.g., SSRIs, MAOIs) may raise the risk of serotonin syndrome (or serotonin toxicity), a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of serotonin in the system. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include tachycardia, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, sweating, and elevated body temperatures.[PMID:32491397] More data is required to verify the level of interaction with such medications.Although St. John’s wort has been associated with fewer side effects compared to some antidepressant medications, the most common side effects reported with its use include gastrointestinal issues (e.g., [abdominal pain] or discomfort, [nausea symptoms|nausea], and [vomiting]), headache, [fatigue], [sedation], [dry mouth], [vertigo], [dizziness], [restlessness], and photosensitivity. More studies are required to further investigate both short-term and long-term side effects of HP and to establish its safety profile when used as an antidepressant.[PMID:11552767]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2451/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/146/edit,St. John's Wort,How does St. John’s wort work?,"St. John’s wort appears to have multiple potential mechanisms of action, some of which have yet to be clarified.HP (and more specifically one of its main active compounds, *hyperforin*) can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and [dopamine]. Although the exact mechanism is still unclear, it seems that HP does not inhibit their reuptake by blocking the presynaptic transporters, as SSRIs do. One hypothesis is that hyperforin instead works by increasing the intracellular concentration of sodium,[PMID:10454515] resulting in an increased concentration of monoamines available to interact with their postsynaptic receptors. This increased neurotransmitter activity is associated with improved mood and relief of depression symptoms.[PMID:32491397]Additionally, both *in vivo* and *in vitro* studies have found that HP also works by activating the *pregnane-X-receptor* (PXR) cytochromes, which play a role in regulating the expression of certain enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system (specifically the CYP3A4 enzyme) and the P-glycoprotein (responsible for transporting drugs and other substances out of cells). The activation of the CYP pathway and/or the P-glycoprotein by HP may contribute to the interactions between HP and other drugs metabolized through these pathways.[PMID:32491397]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2452/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/146/edit,St. John's Wort,Does St. John’s wort have other mechanisms of action?,"Some studies have suggested that HP may inhibit *monoamine oxidases*, a family of enzymes responsible for reducing the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain (i.e., serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). By inhibiting these enzymes, HP may help maintain higher levels of these neurotransmitters, further contributing to its antidepressant effects. However, hypericin and the flavonol fraction of HP appear to inhibit MAOs only at concentrations much higher than those relevant to HP supplementation, therefore this mechanism of action may not be relevant.[PMID:7857510][PMID:32491397]HP also appears to interfere with the [GABA] system in the brain by binding to GABA receptors, which reduces the depressive activity of GABA.[PMID:32491397] More studies are needed to clarify these mechanisms of action, and specifically which compounds in HP are responsible for these effects.Furthermore, *in vitro* and *in vivo* animal studies showed that HP’s active compounds appear to downregulate β-adrenergic receptors, another potential mechanism of action.[PMID:12775192]",

Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine interact with HP, which induces the metabolism of nifedipine and increases the plasma concentration of dehydronifedipine.[PMID:17339138] *Hypericum perforatum* also interacts with verapamil by decreasing its bioavailability through the induction of CYP3A4.[PMID:15060508]Furthermore, taking theophylline (a bronchodilator) with 300mg of HP resulted in  acutely decreased blood concentrations of theophylline through CYP3A4 inhibition.[PMID:21919844] However, when the combination was taken for 15 days, it was found that HP did not play a role in theophylline plasma or urine levels; proper monitoring is recommended when they are given together.[PMID:14681347]The interaction between HP and medications metabolized through the CYP pathway is generally considered unsafe due to the potential for significant effects on drug metabolism and efficacy. However, one study has explored the combination of HP with clopidogrel (an anticoagulant medication converted to its active metabolite by CYP enzymes) for people with reduced responsiveness to the drug, aiming to enhance its effect.[PMID:20980920]",

Red yeast contains *monacolin K*, a compound that is identical to the cholesterol-lowering drug *lovastatin*, a *3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA* (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Lovastatin and other statins (e.g., simvastatin) are metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is induced by St. John's wort,[PMID:10824623] leading to a decrease in the serum concentration of these drugs.

Both HP and [5-HTP] can increase serotonin levels in the brain, and therefore taking them together may increase the risk of serotonin toxicity. This interaction has not yet been verified by *in vivo* or *in vitro* studies.

As a consequence, the drive to diet for specific goals (e.g., weight loss) diminishes, rigid restraints lessen, and unconditional permission to eat grows.

Rejecting the widespread mentality that a healthy weight can only be achieved through restrictive diets2. Listening to the body’s hunger cues and eating when one is hungry, not when one is ravenous3. Eating all foods and rejecting feelings of guilt or judgment around certain foods4. Identifying and challenging negative thoughts and beliefs about eating certain foods5. Recognizing signals of fullness and satiety6. Eating foods that provide both physical and emotional satisfaction7. Finding kind ways to cope with emotions instead of turning to food8. Respecting and accepting one’s body, regardless of appearance9. Moving and exercising for the joy and well-being it brings, not just to burn calories10. Prioritizing overall health and well-being in making food choicesAs outlined in the original IE approach, the first stage of change typically involves a readiness to “try something different” after a history of unsuccessful dieting attempts. This phase is followed by an *explorative phase* during which people consciously refamiliarize themselves with their intuitive signals (e.g., hunger, satiety, and taste preferences) and experiment with new foods that were previously restricted. This conscious thinking then solidifies into long-lasting behavioral changes during the *crystallization phase*, in which obsessive thoughts about food fade, and decisions regarding food become more intuitive. During this phase, people might still exceed their fullness cue, or regularly eat previously “forbidden” foods, but usually in smaller amounts before feeling satisfied. In the fourth stage, called the *intuitive eater awakens phase*, intuitive eating becomes more effortless. In this phase, people may begin to see a shift in their food choices, less fear in dealing with emotions, and increased acceptance and respect for their body. Finally, in the last stage, the *treasure the pleasure phase*, the changes achieved in earlier stages becomes the “new normal”. People in the last stage now view food, emotions related to eating, and physical activity in a different way, honoring and valuing their bodies for what they truly are.[reference|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/1153054501|title=Intuitive Eating, 4th Edition: A Revolutionary Anti-Diet Approach|authors=Evelyn Tribole et al.|published=2020]",

If not, lifelong supplementation could be necessary. Several studies support the use of HA in topical treatments to reduce wrinkles and skin dryness and to improve skin elasticity. HA seems to improve the appearance of wrinkles and helps to hydrate the skin. High-molecular-weight HA is not able to penetrate the deeper skin layers, but does help to hydrate the outer layer of the skin. Low-molecular-weight HA can move into the deep layers, helping with hydration and elasticity. With this in mind, most products combine multiple molecular weights  of HA into a serum. Since low-molecular-weight HA works on the deeper skin layers and does not cause inflammation in topical form, it seems to be the most effective option.[PMID:21412035] While more research is needed to support these claims, so far, the evidence looks promising for topical HA products.[PMID:36200921]Injectable HA is a better-known product, as it is commonly used for facial fillers.

However, it’s important to note that food addiction isn’t formally recognized as a psychological disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Disease (ICD-11). Consequently, FA remains a contentious and debated concept, lacking verified validity.[PMID:37544305]Although stimulation of motivational systems in the brain by food is a natural process, and often a healthy one, some researchers argue that certain highly-palatable foods (especially foods that are highly processed and rich in sugar and fat) can overstimulate these systems. In some cases, this overstimulation might lead to an addiction-like response akin to drug dependence. Food addiction may share some behavioral and neurobiological similarities with drug dependence, including neural alterations of impulse control, altered dopaminergic and endocannabinoid reward pathways, and downregulation of the dopamine system.[PMID:37544305][PMID:36302082][PMID:25692302]",

The YFAS was designed by adapting the criteria for substance use disorder (drug addiction) found in the DSM-5 to the context of addictive-like eating behaviors. Individuals can be defined as affected by food addiction when they meet two or more of the 11 YFAS criteria and experience significant clinical impairment or distress as a result.[PMID:19121351] The YFAS has been tailored for various demographics (e.g., adults, and children) and is available in 13 languages.[PMID:34071059]An alternative assessment tool for food addiction is the Addiction-like Eating Behavior Scale (AEBS), which doesn’t draw a direct parallel to drug addiction. Instead, this scale evaluates food addiction from a behavioral standpoint rather than a substance-addiction one.[PMID: 28676680]It’s worth noting that not everyone who perceives themselves as addicted to specific foods fulfills the YFAS “diagnostic” criteria. Because self-perceived food addicts may be at risk of developing problematic eating behaviors, diagnostic tools for food addiction may inadvertently prevent individuals in this category from receiving diagnoses and treatments for other eating disorders.[PMID: 27939774] Another limitation of the YFAS is that some studies reported frequent overlaps between positive scores of food addiction and other eating disorders, such as binge eating.

In this context, the term “abstinence” doesn’t refer to abstaining from food in general, since one can’t abstain from eating, but to abstaining from specific ingredients (e.g., refined sugar).

However, various hypotheses have been formulated both through preliminary *in vivo* animal and human studies.It appears that drug and food stimuli impact similar regions of the brain (e.g., striatum, amygdala, and anterior insula), and share similar reward system pathways (e.g., dopaminergic, opioid, and cannabinoid systems). Notably, downregulating dopamine receptors (for example, by taking certain medications) might disrupt the reward system and trigger food addiction. The *endocannabinoid system* (ECS) also plays a role in modulating the brain's reward system and in regulating appetite. Conditions such as disrupted lipid metabolism, which is common in obesity, or an increased intake of *polyunsaturated fatty acids* (PUFAs), which is common in the western diet, can influence the production of endocannabinoids and the expression of *cannabinoid type 1 receptors* (CB1), which in turn promote both fat mass accumulation and appetite stimulation, the latter of which may lead to overeating. Obesity has been linked to a dysregulated ECS system, which may be influenced by food intake, and appears to be positively correlated with biomarkers of obesity. This suggests that food addiction in people with overweight or obesity could be linked to a heightened reward-system response to high-calorie/highly-palatable foods.[PMID: 36302082][PMID: 21464344][PMID: 34681224]Translating findings from animal studies to human conclusions is complex due to differing brain and body structures and the intricate human food and social environment, but animal studies can suggest pathways that might be involved in food addiction in people; these could then be explored and verified in clinical studies. For instance, rat studies exploring the potential addictive effect of [sugar] reported specific behavioral and neurochemical changes when sucrose consumption was stopped, including [anxiety], nervousness, and an increase in body temperature, which are similar to the changes observed in drug-dependent rats when drug consumption is stopped.[PMID: 36302082] Another rat study detected brain activity changes similar to those seen in drug addiction.[PMID:20348917]Other studies found increasing evidence that food addiction may be connected to a disruption of the gut-brain axis and intestinal [dysbiosis], which could have any one of a number of causes (e.g., prenatal and postnatal influences, [breastfeeding], environmental factors, diet).[PMID: 34202073] Dysfunctional emotional coping mechanisms may also contribute to food addiction. One study showed that people with food addiction displayed significantly higher emotional eating scores, suggesting that eating excessively may be triggered by feelings such as loneliness, anger, fear, or sadness, in an attempt to overcome them.[PMID: 37544305]",

Cravings for specific foods5. Impaired daily functioning (e.g., at work, home, or school) because of the food addiction6. Eating despite negative interpersonal or social consequences7. Giving up activities because of food8. Continuing eating even when it puts you in danger. For instance, overeating sweets despite having diabetes, or being distracted by eating while driving a car.9. Eating despite negative physical or psychological consequences caused or exacerbated by that eating. For instance, eating despite its causing emotional problems or despite its causing physical issues (e.g., stomach cramps, diarrhea, headache)10. Tolerance, which is the increasing need for more food to feel satisfied11. Withdrawal symptoms (physical or psychological) when reducing food intake (e.g., disproportionate irritability or anxiety)To be “diagnosed” with food addiction, people must both experience significant distress and meet two or more of the above criteria.

However, a key distinction between drug addiction and food addiction is that cravings for foods are widespread and often experienced by the general population. In contrast, cravings for substances like [alcohol] or [nicotine] are typically associated with a substance use disorder. Therefore, cravings shouldn’t automatically equate to addiction. Food cravings can be temporary and triggered by factors such as stress, hormonal changes (e.g., during the menstrual cycle, during menopause, or pregnancy), or exposure to enticing food marketing.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-018-9958-z|title=Effects of addictive-like eating behaviors on weight loss with behavioral obesity treatment|authors=Chao et al.|journal=J Behav Med|published=2019-04-01] Further research is required to define the threshold for pathological food cravings and understand their role in the development of food addiction.",

However, one important difference is that the addictive nature and the neurological influence of addictive substances (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine) on the reward system are well established. In contrast, research still struggles to establish the addictive properties of any specific substances in food. This leads to the likelihood that behavioral factors hold more sway over chemical ones in food addiction and overeating. However, as this is still an ongoing debate, more studies are required to clarify the exact relationship between the behavioral and chemical components of food addiction.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-018-9958-z|title=Effects of addictive-like eating behaviors on weight loss with behavioral obesity treatment|authors=Chao et al.|journal=J Behav Med|published=2019-04-01][PMID:22624087]",

The foods included in the list varied in fat content, *glycemic load* (GL; the GL reflects both the amount of refined carbohydrates in a food and their absorption rate), and level of processing. The extent of processing seemed to predominantly influence a food’s link to addictive-like eating behaviors. Foods at the top of the list were highly processed and palatable, with added amounts of fat and/or refined carbohydrates or sugar; the top of the list included chocolate, ice cream, french fries, pizza, cookies, chips, cake, buttered popcorn, cheeseburgers, and muffins. Additionally, the fat percentage and GL also emerged as good predictors of a food’s addictive potential.[PMID: 25692302] This study presents several limitations. The list of foods was not exhaustive, no food was reported as extremely addictive, and not all participants presented YFAS-measured food addiction symptoms. Furthermore, this study didn’t explore the impact of these foods on specific regions of the brain involved in the reward system, and results were based on self-reporting.It’s worth noting that the addictive properties of certain foods are also reported by people not formally “diagnosed” with YFAS-defined food addiction. Quite often people declare that they have an addiction to specific foods despite not fulfilling the YFAS criteria for food addiction. One study revealed that self-perceived food addicts were more inclined to consume high-fat foods (e.g., chocolate, crisps) than low-fat foods (e.g., grapes), and consumed more calories overall.

There are three primary perspectives on food addiction:[PMID: 30706243]1. **Substance use disorder view:** Some argue that food addiction should be classified as a substance use disorder because of the addictive potential of some foods (particularly energy-dense foods which are high in fat and/or carbohydrates).2. **Behavioral-type addiction view:** Others argue that food addiction aligns more with behavioral addictions like gambling.3. **Nonrecognition view:** Skeptics of the concepts of food addiction and eating addictions assert that these aren’t valid concepts and they shouldn’t be recognized as mental health disorders. They contend that unless specific addictive food components can be identified, establishing an addiction to food may be challenging. Additionally, some studies show that there is often an overlap between food addiction and other eating disorders, particularly binge eating, suggesting that food addiction should perhaps not be considered a separate entity.[PMID: 30188514][PMID: 37544305]Advocates for the concept of food addiction argue that, unlike specific substances causing addiction to drugs or alcohol (e.g., ethanol, nicotine), it’s the combination of macronutrients (typically fat and carbohydrates in high-calorie foods) and food processing that affect the reward system. They note that addiction is not uniform across all substances — for instance, cocaine and nicotine have different addiction patterns, with cocaine use disorder being characterized by binge consumption followed by a break period, and nicotine having a more consistent daily-use pattern — suggesting that food addiction could have its own pattern, while still being considered an addiction.[PMID: 30188514][PMID: 25692302] However, some researchers argue that due to limited data on foods’ addictive properties, food addiction might be better approached as a behavioral addiction in which food cravings play a key role, and should therefore be addressed using strategies such as stimulus control or acceptance-based behavioral techniques.[PMID: 17544361][reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-018-9958-z|title=Effects of addictive-like eating behaviors on weight loss with behavioral obesity treatment|authors=Chao et al|journal=J Behav Med|published=2019-04-01] These strategies may improve weight loss outcomes among patients with high levels of baseline food cravings by focusing on normalizing cravings, accepting thoughts about cravings rather than attempting to change them, redefining and stepping back from cravings, and acting in ways that are in accordance with one’s goals and values.[PMID: 17932235]",

This may occur during a special occasion such as holiday celebration, when distracted while eating, or when presented with a larger than usual portion. However, restrained eaters (people who limit the amount or types of food they eat in order to not gain weight or to lose weight), or those on weight-loss diets, may label breaking their self-imposed dietary patterns or exceeding their personal notion of appropriate intake as “overeating”, even if their consumption isn't disproportionate and would be acceptable to non-dieters. Similarly, some people perceive any amount of a ""forbidden"" food as overeating, even in moderate quantities. For restrained eaters, such self-perceived overeating can lead to guilt or dysphoria, and can potentially result in more “transgressions” or in actual overeating, using the initial breach as justification since the ""diet rules"" are already broken.[reference|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00030/full|title=Overeating in Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters|authors=Polivy et al.|journal=Frontiers in Nutrition|published=2020]Furthermore, individuals often adapt their eating behaviors in social settings. Consuming a subjectively ""normal"" amount of food typically means aligning our consumption with that of those around us. Thus, surpassing this socially established norm might make us feel like we have overeaten. Dieters may also apply restraints in social contexts but struggle to resist tempting foods when alone, possibly leading to objective and physical overeating.[reference|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00030/full|title=Overeating in Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters|authors=Polivy et al|journal=Frontiers in Nutrition|published=2020]",

The word “psychedelic” is derived from the Greek words psychē (the mind/soul) and dēlos (to reveal), and psychedelics have a long history of traditional use for their “mind-revealing” effects.[PMID:28443617] Psychedelic therapy uses “classic psychedelics” like [psilocybin] (most commonly found in certain species of mushroom), *lysergic acid diethylamide* ([LSD]), and *[N,N-dimethyltryptamine]* (DMT) (found in [ayahuasca]), with most current research using [psilocybin].[PMID:35975555] Psychedelic therapy research is rapidly expanding, but it is still considered to be in the early stages and public access to psychedelic therapy is limited. Additionally, psychedelics are still illegal in many regions of the world. Psychedelic therapy generally consists of three phases: preparation, the psychedelic session, and integration. During the preparation phase, the person receiving treatment works with a health practitioner and/or mental health professional to learn about the psychedelic medication, discuss expectations, and set intentions for the experience. During the psychedelic session, the medication is administered in a safe and comfortable environment where the person can be monitored and supported if needed. Afterward, the integration phase provides an opportunity to debrief, reflect on, and integrate the experience. Therapy sessions using various models of support are often provided during the preparatory and integration phases, and in some studies, the psychedelic session is repeated after several weeks.[PMID:36209780][PMID:34293927]",

Currently, the strongest evidence exists for depression and anxiety, including difficult-to-treat conditions like treatment-resistant depression (when two different antidepressants have failed to work) and depression/anxiety related to major illnesses (e.g., terminal [cancer]).[PMID:36209780] Even in people with no apparent mental or physical diseases, psychedelic therapy has demonstrated long-term (>1 year) improvements in well-being.[PMID:32194129][PMID:33143790] The vast majority of research has been done using [psilocybin], although [ayahuasca] and [LSD] have also been studied with seemingly comparable efficacy.[PMID:34519567]A major benefit of psychedelic therapy is the minimal dosing required to achieve a therapeutic effect. Unlike antidepressants, which need to be dosed daily and can take upwards of 4 weeks to begin to work, a single psychedelic session has been found to improve depression and anxiety symptoms rapidly (in some studies within 1 day), with effects potentially lasting 6 months or longer.[PMID:32448048] While positive effects have been consistently shown after a single session, there is some evidence to suggest that two psychedelic sessions produces better results.[PMID:34519567]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2579/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/852/edit,Psychedelic Therapy,What are psychedelic therapy’s main drawbacks?,"Current research suggests that, with proper screening protocols (e.g., the exclusion of people with a personal or family history of psychosis), psychedelic therapy is quite safe. Although side effects can occur during the psychedelic session, they are generally short-term and resolve soon after the medication’s effects have worn off; these include [anxiety], [nausea symptoms|nausea], [vomiting] (particularly in the case of [ayahuasca]), headache, and mild increases in [blood pressure] and [heart rate].[PMID:36209780][PMID:35975555] Psychedelics produce profound short-term psychological effects when consumed in full doses, including changes in thinking, perception, sense of self, and emotions (positive and negative) that may lead to mystical/spiritual experiences and an increased sense of social connectedness. While these “side effects” might be uncomfortable for some people, they are suggested to be an important component of the therapeutic effect of psychedelic therapy.[PMID:35975555]A rare possible side effect that has been identified in case reports is *hallucinogen persisting perception disorder* (HPPD), which is when perceptual disturbances experienced while under the influence of psychoactive drugs (e.g., classic psychedelics, cannabis, MDMA) re-emerge after the drug's effects have worn off. This might include visual “flashbacks” or other disturbances like visual snow (grainy, pixelated vision) or floaters. HPPD has not been reported in any psychedelic therapy studies and the true risk is not clear.[PMID:35599738][PMID:32194129]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2580/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/852/edit,Psychedelic Therapy,How does psychedelic therapy work?,"The mechanisms underpinning psychedelic therapy’s effects are being actively researched, but they likely involve a combination of psychological and biological changes. Psychologically, psychedelic therapy seems to increase insight, enhance emotional processing, and promote psychological flexibility (the ability to adapt our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors when faced with challenging or new situations).[PMID:36209780] This could create an opportunity to shift negative core beliefs and maladaptive thought patterns.[PMID:35975555] Interestingly, having a spiritual or mystical experience during the psychedelic session has repeatedly been found to predict a sustained psychological benefit.[PMID:35975555][PMID:32194129] This can be assessed by researchers using a questionnaire and generally involves positive feelings of oneness/interconnectedness with the world and an intuitive understanding of some aspect of life.[PMID:32194129] At a biological level, psychedelic therapy may induce structural and functional changes in the brain. Classic psychedelics primarily activate *serotonin 2A* (5-HT2A) receptors in the brain, which produces an altered state of consciousness and also seems to activate neurobiological pathways that lead to changes in neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to change in both structure and function. Preclinical trials in mice have found that a single dose of psychedelics increases the expression of genes and proteins related to plasticity, including *brain-derived neurotrophic factor* (BDNF); induces cellular changes (the density/number of neurons and dendrites); and increases learning behaviors. Only a few studies have been performed in humans and the results are less clear, but preliminary neuroimaging studies report shifts in functional connectivity that are sustained after the drug has worn off.[PMID:34566723][PMID:32042038] For a deeper dive into these mechanisms, check out our [study summary](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/1lGEQd/).",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2581/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/852/edit,Psychedelic Therapy,What is the history of psychedelic research?,"The origins of psychedelic research date back to 1913, when mescaline, a psychedelic compound derived from the peyote cactus, was found to induce a psychological state that researchers equated to psychosis. Over the next few decades, research focused on the psychological effects of mescaline, hoping it might bring a greater understanding of the biological basis of mental illness.[PMID:33285579] In 1943, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the psychedelic effects of [LSD] (a drug he had previously synthesized from ergot fungus) through accidental exposure, thus leading to his infamous hallucinogenic bicycle ride home.[PMID:34519567] By 1947, the first human trial of LSD as a psychiatric therapy was published, and the drug began to be distributed by a pharmaceutical company and marketed as a psychiatric medication.[PMID:28443617] During the next two decades, a substantial amount of research was done on psychedelics (most of which does not meet today’s quality standards), the results of which showed promise for a variety of mental health conditions, most notably anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder.[PMID:34519567] However, while psychedelic research was booming, recreational use of psychedelics was also taking off and was generally associated with the anti-Vietnam-War counterculture in the United States. In response, in 1970 the United States government reclassified psychedelics as Schedule 1 controlled substances, making them strictly prohibited and effectively ending psychedelic research, a move that was mirrored internationally by the United Nations in 1971.[PMID:34519567] Psychedelic research was dormant for the next 25 years, but since the early 1990’s it has slowly been making its way back onto the scene.[PMID:28443617]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2582/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/852/edit,Psychedelic Therapy,"In what other contexts are psychedelics used, and how are these contexts different from psychedelic therapy?","Humans have been using naturally-occurring psychedelics like [psilocybin], [N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT], and mescaline for hundreds (if not thousands) of years as healing modalities, recreationally, and in religious/spiritual ceremonies. In some regions of the world, psychedelics hold significant cultural importance to this day.[PMID:32194129][PMID:34063505] In recent years in North America, there has been a trend towards decriminalization, and in some cases, legalization which has led to increased access to some of these drugs. So, does it make a difference if psychedelics are consumed in the Amazonian jungle as part of a ceremony led by a shaman, in the setting of psychedelic therapy, or in your friend's backyard? The short answer: probably.Psychedelics are unique compounds in that their short- and long-term effects can vary greatly depending on the context in which they’re consumed. This is where the concept of “set” and “setting” comes in. “Set” refers to someone’s mindset and overall mental state, while “setting” represents the surrounding environment, including the people in it — both of which can influence the overall experience of taking a psychedelic drug.[PMID:34566723] In psychedelic therapy, both the set and setting are considered and controlled as much as possible. The individual receiving the treatment works with a mental health professional to mentally prepare. During the psychedelic session, the setting is usually warm with a comfortable place to lie, soothing music, and health professionals available to support the individual if they become anxious or fearful. This is a long way of saying that the benefits observed in psychedelic therapy research are not necessarily generalizable to psychedelic use in other contexts. This is not to say that psychedelic use in other contexts holds no merit, there just isn’t a research base to draw any firm conclusions from. Observational trials have found associations between traditional ayahuasca ceremonies and improved mental well-being[PMID:34025402] and reduced alcohol and drug use;[PMID:34308566] however, these trials have a high risk of bias as they’re not placebo-controlled, prone to high drop-out rates, and based on survey results which can make the intervention look more effective than it is.",

While many psychedelic therapy trials are placebo-controlled, the active medication (the psychedelic) produces such noticeable and distinct effects that both the participants and the researchers can reliably guess whether a placebo or psychedelic has been administered. This essentially unblinds the study and introduces bias, such as the placebo or expectancy effects, whereby simply believing you received an active medication and expecting a certain outcome influences the observed effects. This could increase the magnitude of the reported effects of the intervention.[PMID:36209780][PMID:35975555] It’s also important to note that most psychedelic therapy research has been done in populations that are primarily white; there is an overall lack of diversity in terms of ethnicity, culture, and socioeconomic status, which may limit the generalizability of the current research.[PMID:36209780]",

Because of their structural similarity to [estrogen], these isoflavones can bind to estrogen receptors in the body which may help reduce some of the symptoms of menopause that occur due to estrogen deficiency. There are two subtypes of estrogen receptors, *estrogen receptor beta* (ERβ) and *estrogen receptor alpha* (ERα), which are distributed differently throughout body tissues and have different actions. While estrogen binds both receptors equally, red clover isoflavones have a particular affinity for *estrogen receptor β* (ERβ) and only a weak affinity for *estrogen receptor α* (ERα), which means that the estrogenic effects of isoflavones will differ slightly from estrogen.[PMID:16554039][PMID:23882126]Red clover also contains many other bioactive compounds, including the [polyphenols] coumaric acid, [ferulic acid], and [quercetin].

Given the estrogen-like properties of red clover isoflavones, it is important to establish whether supplementation could impact the risk of these cancers. While ERα can stimulate tumor growth, *in vitro* research suggests that ERβ may actually have the opposite function of suppressing tumor growth.[PMID:35872983] Red clover isoflavones preferentially bind to ERβ receptors, which could be beneficial in terms of cancer risk, but they can still bind to ERα receptors, particularly when present at higher concentrations.[PMID:23882126]In women considered to be at a high risk of breast cancer due to family history or breast density patterns, supplementation with red clover for 1 to 3 years did not cause any changes in a marker of breast cancer (breast tissue density),[PMID:18380954][PMID:15084240] although this marker is not considered to be a highly accurate predictor of cancer risk.[PMID:24312387] When looking at isoflavones from soy or red clover, a 2010 meta-analysis found that isoflavones had no effect on breast density in postmenopausal women but slightly increased breast density in premenopausal women, although there were too few cases of breast cancer in the sample to assess the impact of isoflavones on breast cancer rates.[PMID:20511398] Given the rare occurrence of breast cancer, trials with larger sample sizes would be required to more accurately define the relationship between red clover isoflavones and breast cancer risk.",

Mucus is one of the body’s primary forms of defense against pathogens, trapping them as close to entry points (e.g., nose or throat) as possible to more readily clear them out before they can move to vital organs and cause infection. When the body can’t effectively clear mucus that has trapped pathogens, the pathogens can’t be expelled, leaving the entire system susceptible to infection. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive condition that usually shortens lifespan. A lot of time and energy (both on the part of those with CF and their caregivers) is often required to manage the complexities of treating cystic fibrosis.[PMID:24941199]",

Although cystic fibrosis can present at any point in the lifespan, it is commonly identified early in life. Clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis may be confirmed by a sweat test revealing a high concentration (>60 mEq/L) of sweat chloride.[reference|title=Applied Pathophysiology: A conceptual approach to the mechanisms of disease (3rd ed.)|authors=Braun, C., & Anderson, C. |published=2017|journal=Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer][PMID:34934215] Sweat electrolyte levels are raised in the presence of cystic fibrosis, since the condition raises concentrations of sodium and chloride.[PMID:18079549]Cystic fibrosis can be detected as early as gestation: families that may be genetically predisposed to the condition can undergo amniocentesis (pre-birth genetic testing). After delivery, the presence of bowel obstructions or a positive test on the Guthrie blood spot test (which tests for increased pancreatic immune activity) can both indicate that a newborn may have cystic fibrosis. In infancy and early childhood, recurring respiratory distress with cough, wheezing, and/or pneumonia plus a failure to thrive (due to pancreatic insufficiency, present in 85-90% of cystic fibrosis cases) is another set of clinical warning signs.[PMID:18079549] Through childhood and even adulthood, continuing respiratory symptoms, nasal polyps, sinusitis, and congenital absence of the vas deferens (in males) can also signal the presence of cystic fibrosis.[reference|title=Applied Pathophysiology: A conceptual approach to the mechanisms of disease (3rd ed.)|authors=Braun, C., & Anderson, C. |published=2017|journal=Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer][PMID:18079549]Other tests that might be used in diagnosis include: nasal potential difference testing (with results in alignment with cystic fibrosis) and genetic testing for the presence of pathogenic CFTR variants. Gut malabsorption can indicate that pancreatic function is suffering due to cystic fibrosis; this is tested by measuring fecal elastase. Low levels of fecal elastase suggest pancreatic insufficiency and, likely, malabsorption.[PMID:34934215]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2607/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1157/edit,Cystic Fibrosis,What are some of the main medical treatments for cystic fibrosis?,"Once a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis has been confirmed, a primary goal is mitigating future damage, since inflammation and irreversible damage may have already begun. The most important goal is to keep the airway clear, followed by preventing infection. Additionally, maintaining nutritional sufficiency is important since CF’s impact on the pancreas can lead to malabsorption, exacerbating other symptoms for the condition.[PMID:18079549]Management approaches to CF often depend on the stage of the condition and the time of diagnosis. In the earlier stages, airway clearance techniques (e.g., physiotherapy;  mucolytics such as dornase alfa, inhaled mannitol, and hypertonic saline) along with preventative antibiotics and influenza vaccination are often recommended to support lung health.[PMID:35731672][PMID:32358807][PMID:33735508] In the intermediate stages of cystic fibrosis progression, reducing the infection load (through antibiotics and antifungals) and inflammation (via ibuprofen, corticosteroids, etc.) can serve to mitigate the damage done by infection. In the end stages of CF, drainage and even lung and/or heart transplant may be warranted.[PMID:33075159]There are therapies under exploration focused on correcting the mutations of the CFTR gene. Some of these gene therapies carry mixed results and side effects, though, so careful consideration of this approach, with the support of a trained medical specialist, is imperative.

One review, however, has concluded that oral calorie supplements may be no more effective than dietary guidance or monitoring alone. In light of the current evidence, and considering the high costs of some oral calorie supplements, these may not be considered an essential cystic fibrosis therapy for all when less costly measures are just as effective and readily available.[PMID:28470972] [Vitamin D] is connected to lung function, and individuals with lower serum levels (<75 nmol/L) may see an increase in respiratory distress and dysfunction.

However, standard, specific, targeted psychological interventions have yet to be established and validated for people with CF and their caregivers.[PMID:24941199]Exercise (or exercise combined with other therapies such as breathing techniques) is now more commonly being used to ameliorate the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. At present, the evidence is uncertain and still inconclusive regarding whether exercise can actually replace other therapies, and to what degree it can ameliorate cystic fibrosis (if at all).

There are over 1600 possible (known) mutations of the CFTR gene, which exert a variety of effects, some of which result in milder forms of this disease.

However, a second meta-analysis did not replicate these findings for CRP and IL-6, although it did find a significant decreased in levels of the inflammatory marker *[vascular cell adhesion molecule-1]* (VCAM-1). These conflicting outcomes could be attributed to variability in study quality, methodology, and participant characteristics, necessitating further research to validate the anti-inflammatory properties of hesperidin.[PMID:35762134][PMID:30991044]Additionally, one meta-analysis indicated that hesperidin supplementation led to significant reduction of several *[cardiovascular disease]* (CVD) risk factors. These benefits included decreased *triglyceride* (TG) levels, *[total cholesterol]* (TC), *low-density lipoprotein* ([LDL-C|LDL]) levels, *tumor necrosis factor* ([TNF-alpha|TNF-α]), and *systolic blood pressure* (SBP).

However, a number of studies (mostly animal studies), have highlighted potential pathways through which hesperidin may exert its effects.Hesperidin may improve lipid metabolism via several potential mechanisms: In rat models,  a possible pathway involves inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by downregulating the expression of *retinol-binding protein* (RBP), *heart fatty acid binding protein* (H-FAB), and *cutaneous fatty acid-binding protein* (C-FAB). Animal studies suggest that hesperidin may also inhibit the enzymes *3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA* (HMG-CoA) reductase and *acyl coenzyme A:  cholesterol acyltransferase* (ACAT), which play a role in cholesterol biosynthesis.[PMID: 37502716]Furthermore, clinical studies on G-hesperidin (see FAQ “What are the other forms of hesperidin?”) suggest that it enhances *very low density lipoprotein* (VLDL) catabolism, leading to reduced TG and LDL levels. G-hesperidin also appeared to work by activating the *lipoprotein lipase* (LPL), an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing TG. *[glossary:in vitro study|In vitro]* studies further suggested that G-hesperidin may suppress excessive liver LDL secretion by decreasing the release of apolipoprotein B (a key LDL component).[PMID: 37502716]Regarding its anti-inflammatory effect, both *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies suggest that hesperidin may reduce inflammation by suppressing the expression of inflammatory enzymes such as *inducible nitric oxide synthase* (iNOS) and *cyclooxygenase-2* (COX-2), along with inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6), thereby reducing prostaglandin levels.[PMID: 37502716]Additionally, one hypothesis explaining hesperidin’s blood pressure-lowering effect is that it  increases *[nitric oxide]* (NO) production, which induces vasodilation by relaxing blood vessels smooth muscles, leading to a reduction in [blood pressure]. Another potential mechanism involves hesperidin reducing levels of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin-2 through inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.[PMID:37502716] It’s worth noting that these mechanisms remain hypothetical, and require clinical confirmation.Hesperidin and hesperetin also appear to moderately increase [blood flow] either by stimulating the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide, which activates the *Src family kinase*, a group of enzymes that regulate the production of nitric oxide in blood vessels, or through [estrogen] signaling, which is also involved in the production of nitric oxide.[PMID: 21346065][PMID: 18197618]",

It is hypothesized that RKT inhibits the decrease in the expression of the *growth hormone secretagogue receptor* (GHS-R1a) receptor caused by cisplatin (a compound commonly used in chemotherapy) by acting as a 5-HT2B/2C serotonin receptor antagonist, therefore increasing the signal transduction of ghrelin (an appetite-stimulating hormone which binds to the GHS-R1a receptor).[PMID:20171995]Low doses of hesperidin (25 mg/kg in rats) demonstrated notable protection against prolonged toxicity when administered alongside [nicotine] in rat studies.[PMID:17643689][PMID: 20020973]Another animal study found that a 5-week regimen of hesperidin reduced colonic tumor formation by 60%, induced by an injection of a carcinogenic toxin.[PMID: 9163681]In mice, hesperidin also displayed anti-asthmatic and antiallergic properties by reducing the airways’ responsiveness to an antigen. The antiallergic effect was associated with reduced infiltration of immune cells (leukocytes and macrophages) into lung tissue.[PMID:21287361]Finally, hesperidin exhibited various neuroprotective effects in animal studies at standard oral doses.

However, some animal studies suggest potential drug-supplement interactions, warranting caution.Both hesperidin and hesperetin, albeit to different degrees, show inhibitory activity towards cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which play a role in the metabolism of various substances and medications. One study in rats indicated that orally administered hesperidin at 5-15 mg/kg (but not at 1 mg/kg) reduced the metabolism of the antiarrhythmic drug diltiazem, therefore increasing its overall and maximum plasma concentration. This suggests hesperidin’s potential to inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, which are responsible for expelling substances like toxins or drugs (such as diltiazem) and drug metabolites from cells.[PMID: 19505375]In another animal study, rats receiving [orange juice] or a hesperidin supplement for eight weeks exhibited increased exposure and peak concentration of the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin.

In the colon, hesperidin is metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into its aglycone form, hesperetin; a portion of this hesperetin is converted into secondary bioavailable metabolites, which then enter the bloodstream. This emphasizes the potential impact of an individual's microbiota on the bioavailability of hesperidin. However, factors beyond the gut microbiota also play a role. Hesperidin’s source (e.g., sweet orange, tangerines, oral supplements), its form (e.g., juice, capsule, soluble compound), and the processing and storage methods to which it has been subjected also affect its absorption in the lower gastrointestinal tract.[PMID: 32443766] The combined effects of these variables likely contributes to the variablility in the outcomes observed in studies of hesperidin.",

Additionally, lion’s mane appeared to temporarily increase both the richness and evenness of the participants’ gut microbiota, with some retention effect after the treatment ceased.[PMID: 33800983] This means that more species of gut bacteria were detectable after supplementation with lion’s mane, but no specific species or group of bacteria stood out, and it’s not clear whether there were actually more species present after supplementation, or whether the total abundance was simply raised so that more species passed the threshold of detection. Furthermore, participants in this study already had high levels of [alpha-diversity], so even if there was a significant increase in diversity, this does not translate into a clinically relevant improvement.

But what exactly is the difference between red light and near-infrared light?All light travels as a wave of electromagnetic radiation, and the distance between wave peaks is known as the wavelength. The color and type of light are characterized by its wavelength.Red light has wavelengths in the range of about 620–700 nm, while near-infrared light has wavelengths in the range of about 700–1,400 nm. The defining difference between the two types of light is that red light is visible to the human eye and infrared light is not.Our bodies are mostly impenetrable to visible light, including red light.

Furthermore, sunlight is a major source of other wavelengths of light as well, which could enhance or inhibit the effects of red light. For example, while exposure to red and infrared light may reduce signs of skin aging (although the evidence for this is weak), the net effect of getting a lot of sunlight exposure is the promotion of skin aging due to the effect of ultraviolet light.[PMID: 34764376][PMID: 25241726] With that said, it may be worth noting that most sunscreens block UV light while not blocking much red and infrared light (although a small number of sunscreens block both).[PMID: 33640513][PMID: 26846677][PMID: 34387824]Ultimately, whether the net effect of sunlight is similar to that of red and near-infrared light can’t be assumed.",

Although it was well designed, this trial has been criticized as it was sponsored by the same company that manufactured the glucosamine salt used, who not only provided funding but also carried out the statistical analysis.[PMID: 17265490] In contrast, a larger trial of interventions for knee osteoarthritis found that glucosamine alone had no significant effect on pain scores or on the OMERACT-OARSI response, which is a way to categorize how a people with osteoarthritis respond to treatment in clinical trials that was measured as a secondary outcome. However, an exploratory subgroup analysis noted a significant OMERACT-OARSI response to glucosamine treatment in individuals with moderate to severe pain, but not in people with mild pain; since this analysis was exploratory, this finding would need to be confirmed by futher research.[PMID: 16495392] Finally, one meta-analysis of interventions for hip and knee arthritis found that glucosamine may improve stiffness but does not significantly affect pain or physical function, whether used alone or in combination with [chondroitin] (another supplement often used for osteoarthritis and joint health).[PMID: 29980200] It’s also important to note that studies suggesting a positive impact of glucosamine on osteoarthritis indicate that it might slow down the disease progression rather than reverse it.Research on soccer players and bicycle racers has found that in these athletic participants, glucosamine supplementation, particularly at a dose of 3 grams, was able to reduce levels of a biomarker associated with collagen breakdown, CPX-II.

However, the study did not find any differences in sleep onset, number of awakenings, feelings of refreshment upon awakening, or [anxiety symptoms] between the passionflower and placebo groups.[PMID: 21294203] It is worth noting that the passionflower dose used in this study was smaller than that used in other studies looking at anxiety outcomes. Furthermore, this study had a small sample size, was short in duration, and although the outcomes were measured through sleep diaries and *polysomnography* (PSG), the bulk of participants only provided sleep diaries; only ten people underwent PSG.

However, these conversions are limited; they have been estimated to occur at rates of <8% and <4% for EPA and DHA, respectively.[PMID:34553434] There are many factors that can impact the efficiency of this conversion, such as sex, genetic polymorphisms, disease states, and habitual fatty acid consumption.[PMID:22503634][PMID:34553434] For example, premenopausal women can convert ALA to EPA and DHA at a significantly greater rate due to higher levels of estrogen, which can upregulate the expression of the enzymes required for the conversion.[PMID:34553434][PMID:12323090] This likely relates to the importance of DHA during fetal development and lactation. Another contributing factor may be the level of [omega-6 fatty acids] consumed. Both ALA and *linoleic acid* (LA) — an essential omega-6 fatty acid — compete for the same enzymes that convert them into longer chain fatty acids. Restricting LA while increasing ALA intake has been shown to increase levels of EPA and sometimes DHA in clinical trials, although the effect is small.[PMID:25687496] Lastly, the dose of ALA is important.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2747/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1246/edit,Lactation,How is breastmilk produced?,"During pregnancy, a rise in hormones such as progesterone and prolactin stimulates the growth of breast tissue, and the breasts increase by an average of one to two cup sizes. This outward growth is one indicator that the breasts are undergoing the inward growth necessary to support lactation, including the transition of mammary glands (modified sweat glands) into secretory cells, extensive branching of the milk ducts, and enlargement of the Montgomery glands (sebaceous glands in the areola surrounding the nipple).[PMID:5005964] By 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy, the breasts are fully ready to make milk. This marks the first stage of lactation: **lactogenesis I**. The end result is the formation of colostrum (“first milk”), the secretion and production of which is held in check by high levels of circulating progesterone.[PMID:11236732] Colostrum is rich in immunological components (especially the antibody [immunoglobulin A]) and developmental factors (like [epidermal growth factor]). It serves as the infant’s food for the first few days of life.[PMID:18027076] It also has a laxative effect in infants, helping the newborn expel meconium (the first stool).     After childbirth and expulsion of the placenta, progesterone drops and prolactin rises, cueing the second stage of milk production: **lactogenesis II**. This stage is known for copious milk production and begins by the fourth day postpartum with the production of around 500 mL of breast milk (called transitional milk). If lactogenesis II does not occur by four days postpartum, it is considered “delayed”. Approximately 20% to 30% of lactating parents have delayed lactogenesis II, and although the causes vary (e.g., obesity, primiparous parent/first-time parent, stress during delivery), the experience alone is associated with cessation of breastfeeding by four weeks postpartum.[PMID:22575242] Appropriate clinical support of these parents is necessary. The milk produced during lactogenesis II is different from colostrum. It contains less sodium and chloride and more lactose as the closing of tight junctions in the mammary epithelial cells alters what passes into the milk.[PMID:11236732] While the milk production is still under endocrine control, frequent breastfeeding is important if the parent intends to continue breastfeeding. At around ten days postpartum, there is a switch from endocrine control to autocrine (or local) control of milk production. This ushers in the maintenance stage: **lactogenesis III**. During lactogenesis III, the primary driver for increased milk supply is increased demand via milk removal. The breasts will make milk indefinitely as long as the milk is removed and there are no underlying lactation issues. (This explains how wet nurses maintained their occupation in lieu of repeated personal pregnancies.) Consequently, the role of systemic hormones in milk production and infant feeding is much smaller but not absent. For example, the hormone oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary gland and is involved in the milk letdown reflex, and the hormone prolactin is released from the anterior pituitary gland and is involved in milk production. Stimulation of the nerve endings in the nipple by infant suckling or breast pumps is what triggers the release of these two hormones. [PMID:5005964] By the end of the first month, the milk is considered fully mature and offers the infant approximately 0.9 to 1.2 grams of protein/dL, 3.2 to 3.6 grams of fat/dL, and 6.7 to 7.8 grams of lactose/dL.[PMID:23178060] The exact macronutrient ratio does vary, especially when comparing milk from mothers of preterm infants to milk from mothers of term infants, and it also changes with time.[PMID:23178060] When the mother begins to wean her infant and the local signals for milk production decrease, involution begins. Involution is the process by which the milk-producing cells are removed through apoptosis (programmed cell death) and replaced with fat cells. It may take up to 12 months for all lactating cells to be replaced.[PMID:18027076]",

Reduced binding to this receptor could explain the anxiolytic effects of lavender.[PMID:12112282][PMID:29955514]*Voltage-dependent calcium channels* (VDCC) are thought to be related to the inappropriate stress response found in the central nervous system of those with anxiety and other mood disorders. Lavender inhibits these channels, and thus attenuates this response. Lavender also increases the amount of serotonin in the system by blocking the *serotonin transporters* (SERT). SERT are presynaptic receptors that move serotonin from the synapse back into the cell. Blocking these transporters leaves more extracellular serotonin available to the brain, which can improve mood and anxiety symptoms. While this mechanism is similar to the way some antidepressant medications, such as SSRIs, work, there are also some differences, and lavender has a less significant effect on overall serotonin levels than antidepressant medications.[PMID:36717399][PMID:28579958]",

However, the mechanism behind this is unclear, and animal research suggests that the primary fatty acids in EPO (linoleic acid and GLA) and their metabolites may instead be protective against seizures.[PMID:17764919][PMID:23633319]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2758/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/673/edit,Evening Primrose Oil,How does evening primrose oil work?,"The clinical effects of EPO are thought to be largely due to its content of the fatty acid GLA which can have immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects. While less thoroughly studied, EPO is also a source of [polyphenols] which likely contribute an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefit.[PMID:37614101] In the body, GLA is a precursor for *dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid* (DGLA), which can in turn be metabolized into eicosanoids with anti-inflammatory properties, such as prostaglandin E1.[PMID:30110920] Cervical ripening and labor induction during childbirth both depend on prostaglandins, and increased synthesis of prostaglandin E1 is thought to be the main mechanism by which EPO may increase cervical readiness.[PMID:36548328] Similarly, misoprostol, a medication that is used to prepare the cervix for labor induction, is a prostaglandin E1 analog.[PMID:28585102]",

People with darker skin and people who seldom go unprotected under the sun are especially at risk. The only sure way to test for vitamin D deficiency is a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test; if levels are low, supplement.",

It occurs in soil, rocks, and water, and is naturally present in food and drink. About 99% of the fluoride in the body is bound to calcified tissues (bones and teeth), and the rest is in the blood. Despite its presence in the body, it’s debated whether fluoride is an “essential” mineral, and there are no set dietary guidelines for fluoride.[PMID:35365361] Fluoride is also found in many toothpastes and in some dietary supplements. While inadequate fluoride intake leads to tooth decay (dental caries), excessive intake can damage tooth enamel and cause other side effects. To prevent tooth decay, fluoridation of community water has been a practice since the 1960s in the United States.[PMID:35365361] Currently, about 30 Western countries have fluoridation policies, but less than half have active community water fluoridation.[PMID:24719570]",

Higher daily doses (10-25 mg/day) of fluoride can lead to skeletal fluorosis, an accumulation of fluoride in bone, which increases bone density, reduces joint mobility, and can lead to fractures and pain; such high doses can sometimes even lead to cardiac complications. Some evidence suggests that the neurological development of children may be stunted by high fluoride exposure, but more research is needed to be sure. Fluoride toxicity most often occurs due to excessive ingestion of fluoridated dental products and in areas with naturally elevated levels of fluoride in the groundwater (e. g., parts of China and India). In cases of fluoride toxicity, calcium is often used to minimize further absorption of fluoride.[PMID:35365361]",

Absorbed fluoride in the blood can bind with apatite in bone and teeth, becoming fluorapatite. Blood and bone concentrations of fluoride are in equilibrium and are impacted by bone remodeling activity and age.[PMID:35365361] Fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash works locally in the mouth by getting integrated into the structure of the tooth, supporting remineralization of teeth (by speeding up uptake of minerals like calcium and phosphate from the saliva to make stronger crystals on the outer enamel), resisting demineralization by acidic substances in the mouth, and inhibiting the activity of plaque-forming bacteria.[PMID:23429124][PMID:7497353] Fluoride can also be professionally applied as a gel or varnish, allowing fluoride to be released when the mouth becomes acidic, thereby providing longer-term protection to the enamel.[PMID:30829399]",

A meta-analysis of 8 cross-sectional and cohort studies did not find that fluoride exposure via community water fluoridation affects IQ scores in children. However, high fluoride exposure (3.7 mg/L) from natural groundwater in certain geographical areas (e.g., parts of China and India) was associated with lower IQ when compared with lower fluoride exposure (0.7 mg/L). There was no difference in IQ between mean exposure to 0.9 mg/L fluoride when compared to 0.3 mg/L fluoride.[PMID:37120936] Another meta-analysis of 26 observational studies mostly conducted in China found that high fluoride exposure from water is associated with lower intelligence compared to normal fluoride exposure.[PMID:29220711] This data is limited by its observational nature and the presence of various confounding factors.

In some regions of India and China, geothermal and volcanic activity has led to the formation of rocks that have high levels of fluoride. When these rocks are exposed to alkalinity and heat, fluoride is released into the soil and freshwater sources, resulting in high-fluoride food crops and drinking water. Fluoride does not have a taste, odor, or color, and since groundwater is not tested often, high fluoride exposure can go undetected for a long time.

Heme iron is a component of hemoproteins like *[hemoglobin]* (Hb), an oxygen transport protein, and [myoglobin], an oxygen-storage protein found in muscle tissues. Animal products (e.g., meat, poultry, and fish) contain both heme and non-heme iron, whereas plant-based and iron-fortified foods only provide non-heme iron, which is less easily absorbed by the body.[reference|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/iron-HealthProfessional/|title=Iron Fact Sheet for Health Professionals.

The disparity in absorption between heme and non-heme iron has implications for the amount of elemental iron absorbed in the body, with heme iron, typically found in animal products, being absorbed more efficiently.[PMID: 1581009]Both heme and non-heme iron are primarily absorbed in the duodenum and, to a lesser extent, in the upper jejunum (the first and second sections of the small intestine, respectively). Heme iron enters the gastrointestinal tract as ferrous iron (i.e., with a 2+ oxidation state), which is more easily absorbed, while non-heme iron is typically ingested in its ferric (3+) form. However, for non-heme iron to be absorbed, it must first be reduced into ferrous iron by reductase enzymes (e.g., ascorbate ferrireductase), or other compounds like vitamin C. Ferrous iron is then taken up by enterocytes lining the intestine through the *divalent metal transporter 1* (DMT1), and then leaves these cells and enters the bloodstream via ferroportin. Once in the bloodstream, iron is converted back from ferrous to ferric iron and transported by transferrin to various organs and tissues.[PMID: 17729393]After absorption, iron plays a crucial role in several reactions and biological processes within the body, many of which are centered around iron’s roles in protein function and oxygen transport and storage. Iron is required to form hemoglobin (an oxygen-transporter protein) and myoglobin (an oxygen-storage protein). Inadequate iron intake can hinder the production of healthy red blood cells, potentially leading to anemia. In mitochondria, iron serves as a cofactor in proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters (e.g., flavoproteins), other heme-containing proteins involved in the electron transport chain (e.g., cytochrome c oxidase), and proteins that contain iron ions (e.g., monooxygenases and dioxygenases).[PMID: 27911100][PMID: 37383191] Additionally, iron is involved in cell growth and differentiation, electron transfer reactions for energy production, and the regulation of the expression of some genes.[reference|url=https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/44692|title=Iron Supplementation and Physical Performance|published=2013 May|authors=Deli C.

Ferrous bisglycinate is marketed as more bioavailable than the other iron salts, and as having fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, due to its stable chemical structure, ferrous bisglycinate is less affected by common iron absorption inhibitors (e.g., phytates found in cereals). However, although results from a meta-analysis showed that while iron bisglycinate was more effective than other iron salts in increasing hemoglobin levels in pregnant women, in children its effectiveness was comparable to other iron preparations.[PMID: 36728680]*Heme iron polypeptide* (HIP) is another form of iron. It is commonly produced from swine or bovine blood using enzymatic hydrolysis, in which heme iron is bound to peptides derived from the digested hemoglobin.[PMID: 37685181] This form of iron has increased in popularity due to claims that it has enhanced bioavailability and fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other iron compounds.

As a result, researchers have explored different dosages and frequencies of supplementation.One meta-analysis looked at intermittent (once, twice, or three times per week) iron supplementation vs. daily supplementation for improving iron status and preventing anemia in menstruating adolescent and adult women. Both had similar effects on hemoglobin levels and the risk of anemia. However, daily supplementation proved more effective in increasing ferritin levels (although with low quality of evidence), which may be especially significant in populations with a high prevalence of ID, which is characterized by adequate levels of hemoglobin but low ferritin and/or transferrin saturation.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0582|title=Iron deficiency without anemia: a diagnosis that matters|journal=Clin Med|authors=Al-Nassem, A. et al|March 2021] Moreover, there were no significant differences in treatment adherence or in the side effects experienced among participants in the two groups.[PMID: 30699468] There is currently no evidence that intermittent supplementation offers advantages in terms of fewer side effects or improved adherence compared to daily supplementation.In another study, iron-depleted (but not deficient) participants took the same iron dose either daily or on alternate days for 14 and 28 days, respectively. The alternate-day dosing regimen resulted in reduced levels of hepcidin (a hormone responsible for regulating iron homeostasis in the body) and greater iron absorption. However, the impact on iron status remained unclear because there were no notable differences in serum iron, ferritin, or hemoglobin levels between the two groups at the end of the trial. Additionally, the alternate-day dosing group reported experiencing less nausea but more headaches.[PMID: 29032957] A subsequent study by the same author, including individuals with ID, confirmed these findings. However, the study’s duration was too short to assess the long-term effects on iron status.[PMID: 31413088]",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2804/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/75/edit,Mediterranean Diet,What are the Mediterranean diet’s main drawbacks?,"One of the biggest problems with the Mediterranean diet is that it’s inconsistently defined. The modern Mediterranean diet has deviated from the traditional foods and culinary traditions that are native to the Mediterranean region, and several misconceptions have emerged about the diet due to its adoption in Western countries. This has led to the false labeling of certain foods and practices as “compatible with the Mediterranean diet.”[PMID: 29117146]First, the Mediterranean diet is not a purely vegetarian diet — it allows for the consumption of meat and fish. Second, certain foods — American-style pizza, for example — are sometimes mistaken as being part of a Mediterranean diet, but they’re actually substantial sources of calories, sodium, and fat. Third, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes moderate alcohol (wine) intake with meals, but the patterns of alcohol consumption in Western countries have strayed far from the concept of drinking red wine only during meals and spread out over the week. Finally, several foods are sometimes erroneously believed to be Mediterranean diet foods, including avocado, certain desserts, quinoa, margarine, potatoes, and tofu. Ultimately, there’s some confusion about what the Mediterranean diet is, making it difficult for individuals to apply this dietary approach to their lives and limiting the transferability of the Mediterranean diet to non-Mediterranean countries.",

Bioactive plant compounds like polyphenols and [antioxidants] are found in many common staples of the Mediterranean diet, including red wine, olive oil, coffee, tea, nuts, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices. Polyphenols upregulate the body’s natural antioxidant systems, reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lower blood pressure via enhanced [nitric oxide] production, and decrease levels of systemic oxidative stress — all of which ameliorate recognized cardiovascular disease risk factors.[PMID: 20716914] In support of this, a greater estimated intake of dietary polyphenols in participants consuming a Mediterranean diet has been associated with better cardiovascular outcomes, lower blood pressure, less inflammation, and a decreased risk for new-onset [type 2 diabetes].[PMID: 29549354] The high intake of “healthy” unsaturated fatty acids in the Mediterranean diet may also exert health-protective effects, as may the social and lifestyle practices associated with this diet.",

The oldest of these is the Mediterranean Diet Scale (MDScale), developed in 1995 and revised since.[PMID: 12826634] The MDScale includes nine components, including beneficial components (i.e., vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal, and fish), detrimental components (i.e., meat, poultry, and high-fat [dairy products]), ethanol intake, and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids. A score of 0 is assigned to someone whose consumption of beneficial components is below the median and a score of 1 is assigned when consumption is at or above the median. For detrimental components, this is reversed: scores of 0 and 1 are assigned when consumption is at or above the median and below the median, respectively. For ethanol, a value of 1 is assigned to men and women who consume 10–50 grams and 5–25 grams per day, respectively. The total score ranges from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (maximal adherence).[PMID: 12826634]Other scales used internationally include the Mediterranean Food Pattern (MFP), the Mediterranean Diet Score (MD Score), the Short Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire (SMDQ), and the MedDiet Score.[PMID: 31388410] While each score differs in its particularities, all of them assess the intake of similar dietary components, and there appears to be a strong correlation among all the scales for measuring adherence to the Mediterranean diet.[PMID: 31388410]",

The MIND diet incorporates components of both diets, but also includes foods rich in certain vitamins, [carotenoids], and [flavonoids] that are putatively associated with a lower risk for [Alzheimer’s disease], [dementia], and cognitive decline.Specifically, the MIND diet comprises beneficial foods, including green leafy vegetables, other vegetables (e.g., green/red peppers, squash, carrots, broccoli, celery, potatoes, tomatoes, peas, beets, corn), berries, nuts, olive oil, whole grains, fish, beans, and poultry; and excludes detrimental foods, including butter/margarine, cheese, red meat and other processed meats, fried fast foods, and pastries and sweets. As with the DASH and Mediterranean diets, a small intake of wine (1 glass/day) is permitted and seen as healthful.[PMID: 26086182]In cohort studies, higher adherence to the MIND diet has been associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease,[PMID: 25681666][PMID: 36889921] slower rates of cognitive decline,[PMID: 26086182][PMID: 31686099][PMID: 30826160] and better global cognitive function.[PMID: 34334393][PMID: 34092629]To date, [only one long-term (3-year) randomized controlled study](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/dVWbb1) on the MIND diet has been conducted.[PMID: 37466280] Results indicated that in older adults without cognitive impairment but with a family history of dementia, the MIND diet was no better than a standard calorie-restricted control diet for improving cognitive function.

ACTH promotes the release of [cortisol] from the adrenal glands on the kidneys. Cortisol acts on multiple systems in the body in order to meet its needs in times of stress.

However, most RCTs to date have had the limitation of a short duration for examining cognition, usually 1 to 3 months. More, and longer, trials are needed to clarify PS’s effects on cognition.Several trials have been done on PS supplementation in older adults. One 1993 RCT of PS supplementation in older adults noted improvements in both cognition and withdrawal/apathy scores in the participants taking PS but no improvements in activities of daily living. While this early study is dated, it was quite large and long, with nearly 500 participants and a duration of 6 months.[PMID:8323999] Unfortunately, more recent research hasn't clarified PS's potential cognitive benefits for older adults. One 15-week RCT of PS plus [omega-3 fatty acids] supplementation in older adults saw improvements in the supplemented participants on one of two measures of immediate recall, but not on 8 other measures of cognition.

[glossary:observational study|Observational research] suggests that countries that introduced mandatory fortification have seen 30 to 60% reductions in the rates of NTDs.[PMID:31257574][PMID:26562127][PMID:22850218][PMID:30997493] Compared to regions without fortification, rates of NTDs are generally observed to be lower in countries with fortification; however, differences in monitoring strategies between countries make it difficult to draw accurate conclusions.[PMID:26562127] Fortification may have had other positive consequences, including reductions in rates of anemia and reduced levels of homocysteine, which may have translated to a small reduction in the rate of strokes.[PMID:23945721][PMID:30997493][PMID:25323814][PMID:10320382][PMID:16534029] Alternatively, fortification may have led to some unintended negative health consequences. Folic acid fortification has been associated with an increased risk of [mild cognitive impairment|cognitive impairment] in older adults with concurrent low [vitamin B12] levels.[PMID:17209196][PMID:31536147] This could be because folic acid can mask the clinical signs of a [vitamin B12] deficiency, meaning the deficiency may go untreated, potentially leading to irreversible [mild cognitive impairment|cognitive impairment] in the long term.[PMID:17209196] Additionally, when folic acid fortification was being implemented in North America between 1996 and 1998, a short-term increase in the rate of colorectal cancer was observed (approximately 4 to 6 additional cases per 100,000 people).[PMID:17626997] While research has generally found folic acid intake to have a neutral or beneficial effect on colorectal cancer risk,[PMID:29132834][PMID:33742202][PMID:35579178] there is evidence that high intakes of folate might exacerbate preexisting precancerous lesions.[PMID:17895454][PMID:11034085] However, colorectal cancer rates returned to normal after 1998, which calls into question whether fortification was truly the factor driving the short-term increase.[PMID:23352552]Lastly, there is concern that increased exposure to *unmetabolized folic acid* (UMFA) at a population level may have negative health consequences. UMFA occurs when the amount of folic acid ingested exceeds the body's ability to convert it to a usable form of folate, and UMFA has been found in the serum of nearly all Americans post-fortification.[PMID:25733468] Currently, there is very little evidence for or against the safety of UMFA and further research is needed.",

While adequate folate levels may be protective, too little may encourage cancer development, and too much may exacerbate preexisting cancer. The effect of supplemental folic acid on cancer risk has generally been found to be neutral, although research results have been mixed. Folate is required for the maintenance, repair, and methylation of DNA, all of which serve preventative roles against cancer. Accordingly, a folate deficiency can lead to increased DNA breaks, mutations, and hypomethylation, which may increase cancer risk.[PMID:27835893][PMID:32900224] Folate is also required for DNA synthesis and cell division, meaning that it could serve as a growth factor for preexisting cancerous or precancerous cells.[PMID:27835893] Indeed, many cancer cells have increased expression of the membrane receptors responsible for folate uptake,[PMID:15745749] and antifolate medications (e.g., methotrexate, pemetrexed), which block folate metabolism, are effective treatments for some cancers.[PMID:22018948] The vast majority of [glossary:observational study|epidemiological research] has shown that higher intakes of folate are associated with a reduced or unchanged risk of various types of cancer compared to lower intakes.[PMID:35967781][PMID:34472414][PMID:29954131][PMID:29049201][PMID:30647438][PMID:27835893][PMID:35579178] Regarding supplemental folic acid, two meta-analyses of *[glossary:randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]* (RCTs) concluded that supplementation had no impact on the incidence of cancer in general or specific types of cancer.[PMID:29132834][PMID:23338728][PMID:23352552] Contrary to this, another meta-analysis reported an increased risk of prostate cancer with supplementation.[PMID:23338728] In 2023, the *European Food Safety Authority* (EFSA) expert panel stated that there was insufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship between folic acid and the risk of prostate cancer or any other type of cancer.[PMID:37965303]",

Additionally, folate exposure during pregnancy may impact the infants' epigenome (gene expression), potentially influencing health in the long term.[PMID:22124338] In the 1990s several large *[glossary:randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]* (RCTs) conducted in various countries found that folic acid supplementation was effective at lowering the risk of fetal [neural tube defect risk|NTDs] when taken before conception.[PMID:7979565][PMID:1307234][PMID:1677062] In response, folic acid supplementation is now routinely recommended to women who are pregnant or trying to conceive. Because of the clear benefits of folic acid supplementation, it’s no longer ethical to perform RCTs where one group of pregnant women is given folic acid and the other is not. As a result, much of the research we have today is from decades-old RCTs or [glossary:observational study|observational studies], providing an overall weaker evidence base.

After consumption, folic acid must be converted into a usable form by the enzyme *dihydrofolate reductase* (DHFR). However, DHFR can become easily saturated, leading to a build-up of UMFA. The 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that UMFA was detectable in >95% of Americans who provided serum samples.[PMID:25733468].

MTHFR is prone to genetic mutations called *[glossary:single-nucleotide polymorphisms]* (SNPs) which can reduce the functioning of the enzyme, leading to impaired production of L-methylfolate and lower overall folate levels.[PMID:36411563][PMID:25788000] Accordingly, people with MTHFR polymorphisms have an increased need for folate.Approximately 25% of the global population has an MTHFR polymorphism, and these polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of various medical conditions including heart and blood vessel disease, [infertility], certain types of [cancer], and [neural tube defect risk|NTDs].[PMID:26432245][PMID:26497154] However, there’s evidence that when folate levels are adequate, disease risk may be the same as for those without MTHFR mutations.[PMID:12387655] When comparing how people with and without MTHFR polymorphisms respond to folic acid supplementation, people with polymorphisms do see a slightly lower increase in plasma folate levels. Still, folate increases to an adequate level regardless.[PMID:26497154]  Supplementing with L-methylfolate bypasses MTHFR and may be more efficient at raising folate levels in people with MTHFR polymorphisms, but this supplemental form of folate is much less researched than folic acid.",

Since L-methylfolate does not require enzymes like DHFR and MTHFR for activation (unlike folic acid), it has been suggested as an alternative way to supplement folate, particularly in people with genetic mutations that reduce the effectiveness of these enzymes.[PMID:37408570]  Research suggests that L-methylfolate supplementation can increase plasma and red blood cell folate levels to a similar or greater extent than folic acid when given at equivalent doses and can comparably reduce plasma [homocysteine] levels.[PMID:12600857][PMID:16600937][PMID:12421850] Additionally, unlike folic acid supplementation, L-methylfolate is both less likely to mask a [vitamin B12] deficiency and avoids the unknown potential consequences of unmetabolized folic acid in the body.[PMID:21865678] Despite the promising features of L-methylfolate, folic acid has been used in the vast majority of clinical trials, and it hasn’t been established that L-methylfolate provides the same benefits as folic acid — including for the prevention of [neural tube defect risk|NTDs].

Moreover, in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease, *Mucuna pruriens* cotyledon powder was more effective than the same amount of isolated L-DOPA for restoring the brain levels of dopamine, L-DOPA, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and exhibited greater neuroprotective activity.[PMID:15478206]One potential explanation for the findings above relates to the DNA-protective properties of *Mucuna pruriens*. More specifically, it has been suggested that, in the presence of copper ions (the levels of which have been reported to be elevated in individuals with Parkinson’s disease), L-DOPA may cause extensive oxidative DNA damage.[PMID:7957867] While this could be a concern with the use of isolated L-DOPA, some of the constituents of *Mucuna pruriens* have antioxidant and metal-chelating properties, potentially mitigating the risk of DNA damage.[PMID:17622977][PMID:18064727]Another potential explanation for the above relates to the finding that in rodents, at least, L-DOPA-containing preparations of *Mucuna pruriens* are 2–3 times as potent as the equivalent dose of isolated (synthetic) L-DOPA.[reference|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1573(199709)11:6%3C419::AID-PTR120%3E3.0.CO;2-Q|title=Mucuna pruriens proves more effective than L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease animal model|published=1998 Dec|authors=Hussian G, Manyam BV|journal=Phytother Res][PMID:19384573] This higher potency could be due to components in *Mucuna pruriens* acting as dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, preventing the conversion of L-DOPA into dopamine in peripheral tissues, thereby allowing more L-DOPA to reach the brain.[PMID:20570206] It could also be due to other components in *Mucuna pruriens* having anti-Parkinsonian properties.[PMID:17385342]With the above said, the standard treatment with L-DOPA for Parkinson’s usually involves pairing L-DOPA with carbidopa or benserazide (which are dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors). In human trials comparing *Mucuna pruriens* to L-DOPA + carbidopa/benserazide, the findings suggest similar effectiveness at reducing the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, with *Mucuna pruriens* potentially having a more favorable tolerability profile.[PMID:15548480][PMID:29352722][PMID:28679598]",

In the bone, nano-hydroxyapatite crystals in the shape of needles and plates are organized by a network of type-I [collagen], resulting in the structural stability and hardness of bones.[PMID:30020686] As a supplement, hydroxyapatite is a source of dietary calcium which reduces [glossary:bone resorption], which is the body’s process of breaking down bones to ensure there is sufficient calcium in the blood.

Capsaicin can provoke adverse *gastrointestinal* (GI) symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, and heartburn), especially in high dosages and in people with GI disorders (e.g., [irritable bowel syndrome], *[gastroesophageal reflux disease]* (GERD)).[PMID: 18647268][PMID: 27094759][PMID: 33291700][PMID: 10632656] There is some evidence that GI symptoms subside with regular consumption, although more research is needed.[PMID: 24867591][PMID: 21573941]Case-control studies have frequently observed an association between chili pepper consumption and a higher risk of stomach cancer.[PMID: 32241189] However, this finding remains controversial, given the limitations of case-control evidence and the fact that the China Kadoorie Biobank study, one of the highest quality studies on the topic, found that people who ate chili peppers more frequently actually seemed to have a lower risk of stomach cancer.[PMID: 33484129]",

The study administered various doses of chili pepper powder to a group of 8 participants, reporting a small increase in stomach bleeding after ingestion of 100 milligrams of chili pepper powder.[PMID: 3103424] However, there are a few reasons to be skeptical of this finding. For one thing, no clear increase in stomach bleeding was observed following consumption of higher doses of chili pepper powder (0.5 grams, 1 gram, or 1.5 grams). It seems fairly implausible that higher doses would have no observable effect on stomach bleeding, yet a low dose would have such an effect. Additionally, the study measured stomach bleeding using a chemical technique that appears not especially reliable.[PMID: 8791960]Some research even suggests that spicy food might protect against the development of stomach ulcers. A few small studies found that people with ulcers eat spicy food less often, not more often (as would be expected if spicy foods cause ulcers).[PMID: 7895548][PMID: 23853433] And while this could just be because spicy foods aggravate ulcers (leading people with ulcers to avoid them), a few clinical trials have found that capsaicin seems to protect the stomach’s mucous membrane from damage caused by alcohol and certain *nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs* (NSAIDs), including aspirin.[PMID: 16127749][PMID: 7895549]Still, there is limited evidence looking at how capsaicin interacts with *[H. pylori infection]*, which is  believed to be responsible for most cases of stomach ulcers.

MMN supplementation also lowered the risk of stillbirth and the occurrence of diarrhea in children. Moreover, MMN slightly increased maternal and child serum [vitamin A|retinol] levels, slightly increased maternal [zinc] and [vitamin B12] levels, and improved executive function scores in children, compared to IFA.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3051/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/174/edit,Panax Ginseng (Korean Ginseng),What are the different types of *Panax ginseng*?,"There are multiple types of *Panax ginseng* that can be obtained by treating the plant with different mechanical processing methods. Depending on the method used, the ginsenoside composition in the plant changes.Red ginseng, also known as Korean red ginseng, is obtained by steaming *Panax ginseng* at 95–100°C, followed by drying it. This processing method leads to significant changes in the bioactive profile of the plant. While *Panax ginseng* typically contains ginsenosides Rb1, Ro, and Re as its main components, Korean red ginseng is characterized by a high content of ginsenoside Rb(3), which can be metabolized to Rb(2) by intestinal bacteria. Additionally, Korean red ginseng contains ginsenoside Rg(3), which is unique to this variety.[PMID: 20546398] Another variety of ginseng, black ginseng, is obtained by subjecting *Panax ginseng* to nine cycles of steaming at a temperature of 98°C. However, black ginseng is not as commonly used in traditional medicine or supplements.[PMID: 24666107]White Ginseng is a term used to refer to *Panax ginseng* that has been cultivated and then air dried, as opposed to steam dried. The air drying process involves peeling and drying the root until the moisture content is reduced to below 12% and the root acquires a yellowish-white color. Some of the bioactives may be lost during this process.[PMID: 19601793]Another relatively new type, sun ginseng, is obtained by processing *Panax ginseng* at higher temperatures, between 100–120°C, for 2 hours.[PMID: 24666107]Additionally, ginseng can undergo fermentation using fermentation organisms, such as *Lactobacillus* and *Aspergillus*, or various fungal species (e.g., *Ganoderma lucidum*).[PMID: 24666107]",

In men, FSH and LH are important for testosterone production.[PMID:12536359] If GnRH levels are low, LH and FSH will not be released, and estrogen and progesterone will not be produced.As a result, women with hyperprolactinemia may present with infertility, amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual periods), or a low libido. Because a high level of prolactin suppresses estrogen production, symptoms of hyperandrogenism (excessive testosterone and other androgens) may also occur in women. These include hirsutism (abnormal hair growth, often around the mouth and chin), acne, and even decreased bone density.[PMID:24347930][PMID:12536359]   In men, hyperprolactinemia may cause erectile dysfunction, infertility, low libido, and gynecomastia. Other less-specific symptoms could include fatigue and a loss of muscle mass.[PMID:24347930][PMID:12536359]    The most well known function of prolactin is in lactation — in other words, milk production. Since prolactin triggers lactation, a possible symptom of hyperprolactinemia in both men and women is galactorrhea (the abnormal production of milk in the breast tissue). Galactorrhea is more common in young women and is often absent in men and postmenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia.[PMID:24347930][PMID:12536359]   Because of the location of the pituitary gland, a large prolactinoma (prolactin-producing tumor) can result in neurological symptoms like visual disturbances, headaches, and seizures.[PMID:24347930][PMID:12536359]",

A prolactin level of 20 to 25 *nanograms per milliliter* (ng/ml) is considered normal. A level of up to 50 ng/ml may be a normal fluctuation. With a prolactinoma, the level usually exceeds 250 ng/ml. A diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia requires two tests that both show a clearly elevated prolactin level.[PMID:12536359] It is important to remember that prolactin levels fluctuate throughout the day and are higher in the afternoon than in the morning. The blood sample should be taken while fasting and about 2 hours after waking in the morning. In the case of a slightly elevated prolactin level, the sample should be repeated. Some conditions that may cause elevated prolactin levels are seizures or trauma, excessive exercise, and certain medications, such as antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone), antidepressants (e.g., paroxetine), and antihypertensives (e.g., verapamil).[PMID:24347930]If a prolactinoma is suspected as the cause of hyperprolactinemia, an MRI scan is the preferred imaging modality to look for the tumor.[PMID:12536359]",

An agonist produces the same effect on the receptors as the original molecule, so a dopamine agonist will have the same effect on the body as dopamine. Dopamine is part of the *hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis* ([glossary:HPA axis]). Dopamine is produced in the hypothalamus, and higher levels of dopamine decrease the production of prolactin by the anterior pituitary gland.[PMID:12536359] The two most commonly prescribed dopamine agonists are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fainting, and constipation. These are more common in the initiation phase and often subside over time. A newer agent called quinagolide, which seems to have fewer side effects, is available in certain countries outside of the USA.[PMID:12536359] In cases of large prolactinomas or when a person is unable to tolerate the medications, a surgical procedure may be done to remove the tumor.[PMID:24347930]",

This association might not be causal; however, a low vitamin D level combined with an elevated prolactin level can lead to a decrease in bone density, especially in postmenopausal women.[PMID:28595559][PMID:26179930] With this in mind, a vitamin D supplement is useful in certain patients with hyperprolactinemia.

High prolactin levels are expected during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Certain medications, especially those used in psychiatric disorders, are expected to raise prolactin levels, although in some cases they may not cause symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. In those people who do experience symptoms, the treating doctor may decide to change the type of medication. Aripiprazole, a medication that is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder, is the best option in these cases.[PMID:38505795] Additional medications may also be added to reduce the prolactin levels.Hypothyroidism can also cause hyperprolactinemia, and a thyroid function test should be included as part of the work up when assessing a high prolactin level. Other disorders of the pituitary gland, such as Cushing’s disease, might raise prolactin, as might chronic kidney and liver disorders.[PMID:24347930] In some cases, the cause is never found. This is referred to as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia.[PMID:12536359] Sometimes this diagnosis can be explained by macroprolactin, a type of prolactin molecule that is larger and bound to immunoglobulins. It does not bind as easily to prolactin receptors in the body as prolactin does, so it usually will not cause the common symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, but testing will still show a high prolactin level when macroprolactin is elevated. Asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia caused by macroprolactin does not require treatment.

The main function of the HPA axis is to regulate the stress response in the body, and it has multiple different feedback loops that regulate physiological responses to various stressors.[PMID:33519393] Prolactin is regulated by the HPA axis and also acts to regulate other hormones involved in the system. For example, a high prolactin level will slow down further prolactin production and will also inhibit *gonadotropin-releasing hormone* (GnRH) production. Progesterone and dopamine will inhibit prolactin production, while estrogen will increase it.[PMID:29939606]",

Because of this, the body’s feedback mechanisms try to stimulate the thyroid gland by producing more *thyrotropin-releasing hormone* (TRH). TRH triggers the release of *thyroid-stimulating hormone* (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. The action of TRH on the anterior pituitary gland also triggers the release of more prolactin, so prolactin levels increase with TRH levels and TSH levels in hypothyroidism. This does not happen in every case of hypothyroidism; however, it is worth testing for hypothyroidism as a possible cause of hyperprolactinemia.[PMID:29763025][PMID:35147901]",

The commonly used Rotterdam criteria require that two of these three criteria be present to diagnose PCOS.[PMID:36980421] Hyperprolactinemia might also result in symptoms of hyperandrogenism and could cause infertility and anovulation. Because of this similarity, doctors in the 1950s started investigating the possibility that PCOS might cause hyperprolactinemia. Studies done at the time showed overlapping symptoms, and blood tests supported the link, so it was quite a convincing hypothesis. However, modern science and technology have improved our diagnostic abilities when it comes to hyperprolactinemia. In studies done prior to the 2000s, blood tests could not measure macroprolactin, and MRI scans could only pick up large prolactinomas (prolactin-producing tumors). Modern testing can see prolactinomas under even 3 mm in diameter. Macroprolactin can be tested for when the cause of hyperprolactinemia remains uncertain. These two tests explained the raised prolactin levels in many cases that had previously been attributed to PCOS.Recent studies show that these two are likely separate entities, and people with PCOS who have high prolactin levels should undergo further testing to find a cause for the hyperprolactinemia. While more studies are needed to confirm these findings, current evidence suggests that PCOS is most likely not a cause of hyperprolactinemia.[PMID:31523136][reference|url=https://doi.org/10.4103/am.am_50_23|title=A Deep Dive into Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Multidisciplinary Approach|journal=Apollo Medicine|author=Suvvari, TK et al|published=2024-03]It is also worth noting that new diagnostic tools also helped several people misdiagnosed with PCOS.

Group 2A means “probably carcinogenic to humans”, and includes eating red meat, anabolic steroids, indoor fireplace emissions, etc. Group 3 means “not classifiable regarding its carcinogenicity to humans”.

It’s also important to note that it is challenging to prove that foods cause cancer in humans, because much of the evidence relies on observational studies that are unable to prove causality. For example, observational studies have shown that most common food ingredients are associated with both an increased **and** a decreased cancer risk, whereas [glossary:meta-analyses] of such studies find that the claimed benefits of such foods are nonexistent.[PMID:23193004] To summarize, the current evidence does not show that aspartame causes cancer in humans but the evidence doesn’t rule out that it can — *absence of evidence is not evidence of absence*.

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3108/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/304/edit,Vitamin D,Can vitamin D alleviate depression?,"Many people get depressed during the winter months, when we produce less vitamin D. So, can supplemental vitamin D cure seasonal depression, and maybe other types of depression? No, alas — but it may help.Vitamin D is the “sunshine vitamin”,[PMID:22629085] and sunshine is implicated in mood. So it makes sense that researchers have intently explored vitamin D supplementation for depression. But depression is complex, and the mechanisms at work are not well understood. However, careful analysis of the trials testing the effects of vitamin D on depression and mood-related pathways will help provide some insight into whether, or if, vitamin D may be helpful for depression in different contexts or populations. Two reviews of observational studies and intervention trials reached the same conclusions: When parsing the observational data, both reviews found a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D (≤20 ng/mL). When parsing the trial data, both reviews found benefits from supplementation but also assessed some of the included studies as having low methodological quality and high risk of bias.[PMID:27750060][PMID:26951286]Those two reviews were published in 2017 and 2016, shortly after a 2015 [glossary:meta-analysis] of [glossary:randomized controlled trials] (RCTs) reported finding no significant reduction in depression after vitamin D supplementation. Its authors, however, mentioned that “most of the studies focused on individuals with low levels of depression and sufficient serum vitamin D at baseline”.[PMID:25701329] In other words, they didn’t rule out the possibility that in people with higher levels of depression or lower levels of vitamin D, supplementation might be more effective.This hypothesis lines up with the conclusions of a 2014 meta-analysis, which found that, if one considered only the studies whose subjects had low levels of vitamin D at baseline (≤20 ng/mL) and were then given enough vitamin D to achieve sufficiency over the course of the trial, then supplemental vitamin D was about as effective as antidepressant medication.[PMID:24732019] However, this meta-analysis did not account for [publication bias].A 2018 meta-analysis focused on major depression and found a moderate benefit from vitamin D. However, it stresses the low number of qualifying studies (four trials) and, like the 2017 and 2016 reviews, deplores the low methodological quality of some of the studies.[PMID:29943744] Additionally, a 2016 randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in people with major depressive disorder purportedly saw an antidepressant effect,[PMID: 26609167] but this study was retracted in 2021 due to concerns over the validity of the participant data.[PMID: 33974698]Finally, let’s mention a 2016 RCT that found that pregnant women who took a daily dose of 2,000 IU (50 μg) of vitamin D3 during late pregnancy had lower scores on a [postpartum depression] screening scale than those who did not supplement.[PMID:27544544] However, this study only addressed postpartum depression in healthy women with a low-to-moderate pre-partum risk of depression; it may not have wider applicability, and further research is needed. Vitamin D insufficiency (≤20 ng/mL) has been associated with depression. If your depression is severe, you are more likely to benefit from correcting an insufficiency. If your levels of vitamin D are sufficient, however, then whether your depression is severe or not, supplementation isn’t likely to help. (Due to the poor overall methodological quality of the studies, those conclusions are at best preliminary.)In support of this, a number of observational studies have found that people with depression are more likely to have low vitamin D levels.[PMID: 37098201] However, randomized controlled trials don’t consistently find beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression.[PMID: 22073146][PMID: 22205149] One reason for this could be that benefits only occur if a person has sufficiently severe depression symptoms. In support of this, two meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the severity of depression symptoms in people with depression but had no effect on depression symptoms in people without depression.[PMID: 37852593][PMID: 36716601]Vitamin D receptors can be found pretty much everywhere in the human body, so the ways in which vitamin D might affect your mood are innumerable. One of those mechanisms could be hormonal, since vitamin D helps regulate testosterone levels,[PMID:21154195][PMID:20050857] and since low testosterone can impair the mood of both men[PMID:25999864][PMID:24016385][PMID:19707253][PMID:19625884] and women.[PMID:26358173]We should remember, however, that correlation is not causation. As stated above, the observational data suggests a correlation between depression and low levels of vitamin D, but that doesn’t mean that low levels of vitamin D cause the depression. It might be that depressed people go outside less, thus getting less sunlight, thus producing less vitamin D: the depression would then be the cause of the low vitamin D levels, rather than its consequence.Even if depression is a consequence, not a cause, it doesn’t mean that low levels of vitamin D aren’t *also* a consequence. People who go outside less get less sunlight, but also probably less exercise — and we know that exercise benefits mood,[PMID:16862239] both directly and [by promoting better sleep](https://examine.com/nutrition/ten-tips-for-better-sleep/##6-exercise).And of course, a consequence can have more than one cause. For instance, a decrease in vitamin D production during the winter months is a possible factor in *seasonal affective disorder* (SAD),[PMID:26688752] but so is a decrease in illumination,[PMID:26655862] since one meta-analysis[PMID:15800134] and a more recent RCT[PMID:16648320] found that [light therapy] (using visible light, free of the UVB rays that allow your skin to produce vitamin D) can improve SAD symptoms, often as much as can pharmaceuticals. It should be noted, however, that a few trials with small sample sizes make for rather weak evidence, especially since the meta-analysis didn’t account for publication bias.The findings on vitamin D are less consistent. One study found an association between depression and seasonal changes in vitamin D,[PMID:25791903] but another study found no effect of supplemental vitamin D on SAD.[PMID:25125215] And compounding the uncertainty, the researchers of both studies stressed that potential confounders were numerous.To summarize:- Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression, but it doesn’t follow that low levels of vitamin D are the *cause* of the depression. They’re probably one of the factors at play in seasonal depression, but so is the decrease in illumination.- If your vitamin D levels are *not* low, supplementation isn’t likely to benefit your mood. If they *are* low, supplementation is more likely to help if you suffer from major depression.- If you suspect your vitamin D levels are low, you can have them assessed through a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test. Assessing your vitamin D levels twice in a year — in midsummer and midwinter, when there is the most and least sunlight — is an efficient way of estimating what your levels are around the year.",

One [glossary:randomized clinical trial] showed that 5–9 grams of  *Artemisia annua* consumed as 4 cups of tea daily for 7 days resulted in a cure rate of only up to 34% at 35 days, compared to a 79% cure rate with 1500 mg of quinine daily for 7 days.[PMID:15109558] One randomized clinical trial comparing *Artemisia annua* tea to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, one of the standard treatments, was stopped early due to high rates of malaria recurrence in the groups taking the tea.[PMID:18453510] *Artemisia annua*’s constituent artemisinin is used to produce semisynthetic derivatives (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, and artemether) with standardized dosages and longer half-lives. These derivatives are formulated in combination with other antimalarial drugs to ensure the eradication of malaria parasites and to reduce the risk of the parasites becoming resistant to artemisinin. *Artemisinin-based combination therapies* (ACTs) are the WHO’s preferred treatment for malaria as of October 2023. There is concern about the continued effectiveness of these treatments, as resistance of the parasites to artemisinin has been increasing.[PMID:33482666][PMID:36580567]",

The choline metabolite phosphatidylcholine is also required for packaging and exporting very-low-density lipoproteins from the liver and the secretion of bile acid salts; the disruption of this process can contribute to the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver.[PMID: 4340541][PMID: 5725875][PMID: 9498371][PMID: 3182819][PMID: 10417327]",

The main dietary sources of choline are animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs, as well as some cruciferous vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. The top sources of choline are beef liver (3 ounces contains 356 mg of choline), [eggs] (one large egg contains 147 mg of choline), beef (3 ounces contains 117 mg of choline) and soybeans (one half of a cup contains 107 mg of choline).[reference|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/|title=Choline: Fact Sheet for Health Professionals; USA: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements; last updated 2 June 2022; cited April 2024|published=2018]Choline can also be obtained from dietary supplements that contain choline, choline + B vitamins, and multivitamin/multimineral products.

Beta-glucans can be taken as a supplement or consumed as part of the diet, with the richest dietary sources being oats, barley, oyster mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms.[PMID:38542811] All beta-glucans consist of chains of glucose molecules linked via β-glycosidic bonds, but the chain length, branching, and types of β-linkages can vary, leading to differences in biological activity and physical characteristics. For example, cereal beta-glucans are soluble, consisting of unbranched chains of glucose units linked with a mixture of β-(1,3) and  β-(1,4) bonds. On the other hand, fungal beta-glucans can be soluble or insoluble, and their glucose units are linked with β-(1,3) bonds, with or without branches attached via  β-(1,6) bonds.

An antiobesity effect has been noted in some studies done on rodents. Using *20-hydroxyecdysterone* (20HE) in rats and gerbils on a high-calorie diet mitigated weight gain compared to control groups.[PMID:19126784][PMID:20097286][PMID:33947076] 20HE has also been shown to inhibit glucose production in rats and to lower glucose in a manner that is similar to some of the commonly used diabetic treatments, like metformin.[PMID:19176784] This could be helpful in people with [prediabetes] or [type 2 diabetes], but it is not yet well studied in human populations.In [menopause|menopausal] and postmenopausal women, 20HE could help to decrease adipose deposits, particularly visceral fat (fat around the abdominal organs) and fat deposits in the muscles and joints.

Ecdysteroids may act through a *G-protein coupled receptor* (GPCR), a receptor found on cell membranes that plays a role in cellular signaling. Specifically, ecdysteroids might bind to GPCRs found in the *renin-angiotensin system* (RAS) — an important regulator of fluids, blood volume, and vasodilation that acts within the kidney. Ecdysteroids activate the MAS1 proto-oncogene (genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation) within this system, and this could enhance muscle protein synthesis.[PMID:33947076][PMID:34825653]Ecdysterone also causes an influx of calcium ions into the cells, which causes an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt. Akt is a protein kinase that mediates protein synthesis, so if ecdysterone increases its activity, then this could be the mechanism through which it enhances muscle growth.[PMID:20363237] Finally, a type of estrogen receptor called *estrogen receptor beta* (ERβ) might be responsible for the actions of ecdysteroids in humans. The activation of ERβ has been related to muscle protein synthesis, and ecdysteroids have been shown to activate this receptor.[PMID:33947076] The current data on how ecdysteroids work in mammals, and particularly in humans, is limited, and further research into the mechanisms of action is needed.",

Ibutamoren interacts with *growth hormone-releasing hormone* (GHRH) and stimulates the release of growth hormone and *insulin-like growth factor-1* (IGF-1). This can increase hunger and also reduce nitrogen wasting during energy restriction. Nitrogen wasting occurs when proteins (e.g., in muscles) are broken down into amino acids for energy and then removed from the body usually via urine.[PMID:32257855] Reduced nitrogen wasting is thought to be how ibutamoren increases fat-free mass.",

Adding hydrogen gas to the breathing mixture as a substitute for nitrogen is one method for reducing the side effects of nitrogen gas in high-pressure environments. This isn’t through any drug-like effects of hydrogen, though; it’s simply because it’s replacing nitrogen gas so that less nitrogen can dissolve into the blood during a dive.[PMID:18876410][PMID:8005852]Preliminary research also points to potential benefits in [metabolic syndrome], [nonalcoholic fatty liver disease], recovery following a heart attack or cardiac arrest, [rheumatoid arthritis], cancer, [exercise capacity], and some respiratory conditions.[PMID:38067515][PMID:36708550][PMID:38256045]",

Its small size allows it to interact directly with mitochondria, possibly benefiting mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Furthermore, hydrogen seems to increase the body’s own antioxidant mechanisms, resulting in a prolonged antioxidant effect even once it has been cleared from the body.[PMID:34987419] The anti-inflammatory effects of molecular hydrogen may be related to the antioxidant effects, but hydrogen also seems to inhibit inflammatory pathways directly.

In 2018, NMN was granted GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status by an FDA panel in 2018, which made it legal for use as a food additive. GRAS designation doesn’t apply to supplements, however—only food or food additives. For a product to be marketed and sold as a supplement, manufacturers need to submit a notification of a “New Dietary Ingredient” (NDI) to the FDA, before bringing the product to the market. NDI's contain information providing the basis for concluding that the supplement is reasonably safe and, if approved by the FDA, pave the way for sales and marketing as a supplement.One company did [successfully](https://downloads.regulations.gov/FDA-2022-S-0023-0029/content.pdf) get an NDI approved by the FDA for NMN supplements in 2022, which gave NMN the appropriate legal status for supplement sales. However, later the same year, the FDA changed their stance on NMN’s status as a dietary supplement. Several companies that were testing NMN in clinical trials successfully lobbied the FDA to have NMN classified as an investigational drug. This effectively made NMN supplement sales illegal according to [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff) (section 201(ff)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2021-title21/USCODE-2021-title21-chap9-subchapII-sec321) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which prevents the sales or marketing of agents classified as investigational drugs.   This prompted the FDA to [revoke the NDI](https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2022-S-0023-0051), which effectively banned the sales and marketing of NMN supplements in the US. Technically, selling NMN as a food additive is still legal, since NMN’s GRAS status was not affected by the withdrawal of the NDI.   Nonetheless, most retailers stopped selling NMN products considering its uncertain legal status.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3184/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/963/edit,Akkermansia muciniphila,How does *Akkermansia muciniphila* work?,"Exactly how *Akkermansia muciniphila* works is still an area of exploration. Current research suggests that *A. muciniphila* naturally existing in our intestines may influence our health by directly interacting with aspects of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system and by producing metabolites like *[short-chain fatty acids]* (SCFAs). However, whether this applies to *A. muciniphila* taken as a supplement still needs to be determined. *A. muciniphila* breaks down and feeds on mucin, the major component of the mucus layer that lines our gastrointestinal tract. This is thought to stimulate the turnover and production of mucus, which contributes to the health of the intestines. *A. muciniphila* also produces SCFAs, specifically propionate and acetate, as a byproduct of mucin degradation. These SCFAs are thought to regulate appetite, increase insulin sensitivity, decrease inflammation in the gut, and improve gut barrier integrity. Furthermore, *A. muciniphila* can interact with the immune system through *Toll-like receptor 2* (TLR2), which regulates many biological functions, again including insulin sensitivity and gut barrier integrity.[PMID:38384263][PMID:33449810][PMID:27892954][PMID:37111034] Interestingly, a surface protein on *A. muciniphila*, Amuc_1100, has been shown to replicate many of the effects of live *A. muciniphila* in animal models, possibly through activation of TLR2. Amuc_1100 is also stable at temperatures used for pasteurization, which could explain why pasteurized  *A. muciniphila* seems to maintain some of its effects.[PMID:37111034][PMID:27892954]The gut [glossary:microbiome] is very much its own ecosystem living within our intestines, and it’s important to note that *A. muciniphila* does not exist in isolation but rather as part of this complex ecosystem. The dynamic interplay between microbes within the ecosystem (and between our body and the gut microbiome) is complicated and only beginning to be understood. It’s quite possible that how *A. muciniphila* “works” relates less to its individual effects and more to its role within a larger ecosystem.",

The effects appear to be highly dependent on the person, and it’s not clear whether simply increasing the levels of *A. muciniphila* improves health outcomes. *Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols* (FODMAPs) are a category of dietary carbohydrates found in varying levels in fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and grains.

A1 beta casein was noted as a natural genetic change in European cattle when a histidine molecule was replaced with a proline molecule in this amino acid chain. The ingestion of A1 beta casein (but not A2) leads to the formation of *beta-casomorphin-7* (BCM7), a peptide that has been associated with several health concerns.*[glossary:In vitro]* and animal studies have shown an association between the BCM7 peptide and type 1 [diabetes], [allergic rhinitis|allergies], and [cardiovascular disease]. However, there is no evidence showing a causative link between the ingestion of A1 beta casein and any chronic health condition in humans. Some human studies have shown greater gastrointestinal distress with A1-containing milk than with A2-containing milk, possibly due to an inflammatory response to the BCM7 peptide. This could be helpful to people with symptoms of lactose intolerance, because it is possible that A2-containing milk could cause fewer symptoms than mixed A1/A2 milk.

Tryptophan can be converted into 5-HTP in the body; however, supplementing with 5-HTP directly is more reliable for increasing serotonin levels.The conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of both [serotonin] and [melatonin]. This means that the speed with which the body can produce serotonin or melatonin relies on how quickly tryptophan can be converted to 5-HTP. When supplementing with 5-HTP, this rate-limiting step is bypassed.[PMID:33375373] Several factors can limit the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP. For one, tryptophan has many different fates within the body (such as protein synthesis), meaning only a small fraction is converted to 5-HTP and subsequently serotonin. However, 5-HTP has the sole purpose of serotonin synthesis. Furthermore, tryptophan has to compete with other amino acids for entry into the brain, while 5-HTP can passively enter the brain without challenge.[PMID:31504850][PMID:32541380][PMID:9727088]",

Medications metabolized by CYP3A4 are called [CYP3A4 substrates].[PMID:36737277] Grapefruit contains certain compounds — furanocoumarins — that can form strong and stable covalent bonds with CYP3A4, primarily in the intestine. This renders the enzyme inactive and impairs the body’s ability to metabolize the medication.[PMID:36737277] Most of the time, this leads to higher-than-intended levels of the drug in the body, which can cause side effects and even toxicity. Additionally, some medications called prodrugs rely on CYP3A4 to convert them into an active form. In these cases, the medications may be less effective, which could result in treatment failure. Because the inhibition of CYP3A4 by grapefruit is irreversible, CYP3A4 enzyme activity remains suboptimal until the body makes new enzymes or until the epithelial lining of the intestine is shed, which usually takes upwards of 24 hours.[PMID:17971226] To complicate matters further, grapefruit also seems to inhibit the drug efflux pump *p-glycoprotein* (P-gp) and the *organic anion-transporting polypeptide* (OATP) transporters OATP1A2 and OATP2B1.

However, grapefruit inhibits this enzyme, raising the question of whether grapefruit might lead to elevated estrogen in the body and potentially an increased risk of breast cancer. Although biologically plausible, research has not provided a clear answer. In one [glossary:observational study], higher grapefruit consumption was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. However, in two other studies, no association was found.[PMID:19224379][PMID:18026192] Furthermore, a study examining the effects of grapefruit on endogenous estrogen levels in postmenopausal women reported unclear and contradictory effects.

However, it’s important to check with your physician or a pharmacist before using L-tyrosine supplements while taking NDRIs.  *Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors* (NDRIs) are a class of pharmaceuticals used to treat depression, which work by suppressing the absorption of the catecholamines [dopamine] and [noradrenaline|norepinephrine] within neurons. Their mechanism of action involves blocking a negative feedback mechanism by suppressing a specialized group of receptors responsible for the reuptake of catecholamines within the synapses of neurons. By suppressing norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake, NDRIs prolong the ability of these neurotransmitters to propagate signals in the CNS. L-tyrosine can be converted to catecholamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, but this enzyme is *feedback inhibited* when catecholamine levels are elevated.[PMID: 21176768] In other words, increased catecholamine levels from concurrent NDRI use would likely suppress the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, reducing the potential of adverse interactions while taking L-tyrosine supplements.

The results of a trial examining BEO’s effects on postsurgical anxiety were similar. An RCT whose participants were postsurgical ICU patients found that the participants’ scores on an anxiety questionnaire decreased significantly with bergamot aromatherapy compared to the control group.[PMID: 38490827] However, even though the participants in this small study were randomized, significantly more control-group than bergamot-group participants had had prior ICU experiences, and significantly more bergamot-group patients had a known allergy to something other than plants, flowers and related essential oils — both of which could have affected post-surgical anxiety levels.However, there is limited evidence that BEO aromatherapy may be ineffective or even counterproductive for medical anxiety in children. A 2019 RCT examining the effects of BEO aromatherapy on medical-office anxiety in [autism spectrum disorder|autistic] children found no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, or scores on a standardized anxiety questionnaire.[PMID:31415008] Worse, a 2012 RCT of BEO aromatherapy in children and adolescents undergoing stem cell transplantation, a stressful, nauseating, and painful procedure, found that the participants who received BEO aromatherapy experienced *more* anxiety and nausea than the participants who didn’t.[PMID:22383266]",

For example, the gastrointestinal tract secretes various hormones to signal the brain to regulate food (energy) intake. The most-studied gut hormones include [ghrelin], *[glp-1|glucagon-like peptide-1]* (GLP-1), *cholecystokinin* (CCK), *pancreatic polypeptide* (PP), *[peptide YY]* (PYY), and oxyntomodulin. Ghrelin, secreted by the intestines, increases food intake and gastric motility; in obesity, its secretion is abnormal, and bariatric surgery seems to reduce its secretion after eating. GLP-1, secreted by the intestines, reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, and suppresses [glucagon] secretion. Postmeal GLP-1 levels are reduced in people with obesity, and bariatric surgery seems to correct the reduction. In fact, [faq:what-are-glp-1-receptor-agonists|GLP-1 agonists] are a medication class that mimics this hormone, and they are used therapeutically for obesity. CKK, secreted by the duodenum, reduces appetite and slows gastric motility. In obesity CKK’s effects on the appetite are blunted, and these effects seem to normalize after bariatric surgery. PP, secreted by the pancreas, seems to be able to both decrease and increase appetite, depending on where it exerts its effect. PP is structurally related to PYY, which is secreted by the intestines and decreases appetite and gut motility. PYY secretion was found to be reduced in people with obesity, and it increased after bariatric surgery. Oxyntomodulin, secreted by the intestines, reduces food intake and gastric motility. It acts on similar receptors as GLP-1 but produces a smaller incretin effect (the release of insulin in response to increased glucose in the blood). Since the incretin effect regulates blood glucose, there is interest in using oxyntomodulin to treat obesity in people without diabetes, who do not need help regulating blood glucose.[PMID:16815798][reference|url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cophys.2019.04.007|title= The role of gut hormones in the pathogenesis and management of obesity|authors= Makaronidis JM, Batterham RL|journal=Curr Opin Physiol|published=2019-12]",

These varied definitions look at malnutrition from different perspectives that could be based on anthropometrics (measurements of body weight and size), medical imaging to assess muscle mass, markers of inflammation, and micronutrient deficiencies. There are a lot of factors to consider when defining malnutrition, such as insufficient intake, poor absorption, interactions between different nutrients, individual needs, medical conditions, and the effects of medications.[PMID:29145755]The World Health Organization (WHO) includes 3 types of malnutrition in their definition: undernutrition, micronutrient-related malnutrition, and overweight and obesity (overnutrition). Undernutrition includes several subcategories of malnutrition, namely wasting (low weight for height), stunting (low height for age), and underweight (low weight for age). These categories are often noted in childhood development but can also apply to adults. Micronutrient-related malnutrition could refer either to a deficiency of certain nutrients due to insufficient intake or to an excessive intake of certain micronutrients. Lastly, overweight and obesity are a result of an excess intake of energy. In some cases, this can still involve micronutrient deficiencies. Some definitions of malnutrition also include health conditions — such as [diabetes] and heart disease — that can be a direct result of overweight or obesity.[reference|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malnutrition|title=Malnutrition; World Health Organization, cited 2024-09, updated 2024-03]",

Muscle weakness could result in difficulty with normal tasks like getting dressed or taking a walk. Very low intake or poor absorption of food could result in low [blood glucose|blood sugar] levels and [electrolytes|electrolyte] disturbances.[PMID:29145755] In [micronutrient] malnutrition, the symptoms could be related to the inappropriate levels of a specific vitamin or mineral.

BMI is often used as a starting point because it is easily determined and provides quick information. Other gauges of body composition, like a [glossary:dxa-dexa|DEXA scan] or CT scan, might be more accurate but require equipment and financial resources.  The current malnutrition diagnostic criteria do not include the [overweight] and [obesity] (overnutrition) or micronutrient types of malnutrition.

A BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. Measuring the waist circumference can also be an indicator of the distribution of excess adipose (fat) tissue.[PMID:15355950] Micronutrient malnutrition can occur in both undernutrition and overnutrition. Blood tests for micronutrient deficiencies are ordered based on symptoms, physical examination findings, and diagnosis. For example, testing for a [vitamin B12] deficiency would be helpful in someone who is using medication for [stomach ulcers] and experiencing numbness in the feet and hands (peripheral neuropathy).[PMID:35365361]",

Increasing physical activity increases the amount of calories burned and works in tandem with calorie-restricting diets for weight loss.[PMID:24222017] In some cases, medications or surgical interventions might also be recommended. In both undernutrition and overweight and obesity, if there is a deficiency of a certain vitamin or mineral, it might be replaced through an oral supplement, an intravenous supplement, or fortified foods.[PMID:31277488]Most of the people who are diagnosed with malnutrition can benefit from the education and support provided by a dietitian.[PMID:31277488]",

The diagnosis of malnutrition is based on the circumference of the mid-upper arm and the weight and height of the child. Variations on the diagnostic criteria exist, but most use these measures to define malnutrition in a child.[PMID:32806622]Two other syndromes of malnutrition have been described in children. Marasmus, which means “wasting”, is the physiological effects of insufficient calories over a period of months or years. Children with this syndrome are extremely underweight, have little muscle tissue, and are lethargic. The second syndrome is kwashiorkor, which means “the sickness of weaning”. Children with kwashiorkor are not energy deficient but are protein deficient. As a result, they lose muscle, develop skin conditions, and have edema (fluid retention) that causes them to have swollen feet and abdomens. A combination of the two is also possible, resulting in severe muscle loss and edema.[PMID:32806622][PMID: 23528324]Children with moderate malnutrition can be treated at home with calorie-rich foods like peanut butter, milk powders, and vegetable oils. They may be given vitamin supplements to drink at home as well. Counseling on nutrition for the caretakers is important in these cases, and regular follow up at the doctor is advisable.  In severe cases, the child may need to be treated in a hospital, especially to monitor [blood glucose] levels, body temperature, and hydration status.

List of Classifications: Agents classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–136; cited 2024-09-11|authors=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)] This means that “there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and either sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals or strong mechanistic evidence” from cell-culture experiments (*[glossary:in vitro]* studies).[reference|url=https://monographs.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IARCMonographs-QA.pdf|title=IARC Monographs on the Identification of Carcinogenic Hazards to Humans: Questions and Answers, 2019-12-10|authors=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)] In humans, this evidence comes from epidemiological [glossary:observational studies] that have shown that higher dietary intakes of nitrate are associated with an increased risk of some types of [cancer].[PMID:35277025][PMID:33298332][PMID:30850575][PMID:36851064] Further human evidence is derived from studies that show that drinking tap water that contains high levels of nitrate is associated with several conditions, including [colorectal cancer].[PMID:30041450] Similarly, an excessive nitrate intake from processed foods has also been associated with an increased risk of conditions, including [gastrointestinal cancer].[PMID:19439460] However, the strength of the association between nitrate intake and cancer risk is variable between the studies, and some studies show that a greater nitrate intake is associated with a lower risk. Consequently, it is unclear whether consuming nitrate directly causes cancer in humans. The associations between nitrate intake and cancer risk might be explained by the formation of *N-nitroso compounds* (NOCs) caused by nitrate. This is important because, like nitrate, several N-nitroso compounds have also been classified as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”.[reference|url=https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications|title=IARC Monographs on the Identification of Carcinogenic Hazards to Humans. List of Classifications: Agents classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–136; cited 2024-09-11|authors=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)] Interestingly, drinking water containing nitrate can lead to increased levels of NOCs,[PMID:9681972][PMID:31623611] and high levels of red meat ingestion are also associated with higher levels of NOCs in the body.[PMID:9681972][PMID:25164923][PMID:22019696][PMID:11159760] One clinical study has even shown that drinking beetroot juice can cause a small increase in the formation of NOCs.[PMID:31072023] The above-described information indicates that ingesting nitrate has the potential to cause cancer. It even suggests that drinking beetroot juice in excessive amounts *might* pose a health risk due to the possible formation of NOCs. However, there is no known association between drinking beetroot juice and cancer risk.[PMID:32292042] Additionally, nitrate intake through plant-based food sources ([green leafy vegetables], beetroot, etc.) has never been found to be associated with health risks. Furthermore, nitrate-containing vegetables (including beetroot) also contain many other nutrients — vitamins and [phytochemicals] — that function as [antioxidants] and can inhibit the conversion of nitrate into NOCs.[PMID:21141240] Therefore, the cancer risk from drinking beetroot juice or eating nitrate-containing vegetables is likely to be very low. Furthermore, it is generally agreed that consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables can protect against chronic conditions, including cancer.[reference|url=https://publications.iarc.fr/Book-And-Report-Series/Iarc-Handbooks-Of-Cancer-Prevention/Fruit-And-Vegetables-2003|title=Fruit and Vegetables: IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention, Volume 8. IARC Press|published=2003|authors=Alink, G., et al][PMID:31758189]To summarize, while consuming nitrates in excessive levels may increase the risk of cancer, it is currently believed that nitrate is unlikely to pose a major risk in the amounts people typically consume. However, if people want to reduce their exposure to any potential hazard posed by nitrate, they can choose to refrain from eating processed meats and from drinking tap water in nitrate-contaminated areas.",

Lemon balm may be more effective for immediate or situational (acute) anxiety than for long-term (chronic) anxiety. In the reviewed studies, lemon balm decreased acute anxiety in hospitalized patients with burns, acute coronary artery syndrome, and coronary artery bypass grafts, as well as in teenage girls with [PMS], with an overall large effect size; it also decreased chronic anxiety in office workers and hospitalized patients with chronic stable angina, with an overall moderate effect size.[PMID:34449930] However, there was a high risk of bias in most of the studies; more high-quality research is needed.Based on the available evidence, lemon balm may also be useful for [depression].

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3388/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/479/edit,Lemon Balm,How effective is lemon balm at treating herpes sores?,"There are two types of *herpes simplex virus* (HSV): HSV-1 and HSV-2. Following the initial infection, HSV often becomes chronic, causing recurrent outbreaks of sores in either the oral or genital areas. Oral herpes is typically, but not always, caused by HSV-1; genital herpes is typically, but not always, caused by HSV-2. The sores (in oral herpes, “cold sores”) are often preceded by a tingling sensation, followed by blistering, which can be quite painful. The sores will resolve on their own without treatment in 2 to 3 weeks. There is no cure for HSV infection, but the duration of the sores can be reduced by treatment with oral or topical (applied to the skin) antiviral medication at the first sign of an outbreak; in people who have frequent outbreaks or are immunocompromised, the frequency of outbreaks may be reduced with longer courses of oral antivirals.[PMID:29489260][PMID:32119314] Many people with HSV use a commercial over-the-counter cream containing 1% dried [lemon balm] extract to treat oral or genital herpes sores.[PMID:33115318] Two [glossary:randomized-controlled-trial|randomized, placebo-controlled trials] of lemon balm cream for herpes sores have been published in English; the cream was moderately effective compared to the placebo.[reference|url=https://www.reliasmedia.com/ext/resources/pdfs/articles/83/832/8324/83241/83241.pdf|title=Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) for Treatment of Herpes Labialis|author=McQueen CE|published=May 2000|journal=Pharm diet suppl alert][PMID:10589440][PMID:23195812] The first one, a 1994 trial in Germany in 115 people with oral or genital herpes who applied either 1% lemon balm cream or a [glossary:placebo] to the affected skin 2–4 times daily for 5–10 days, found that the cream reduced second-day redness and swelling, but not scabbing, lesion size, the number of blisters, or pain, compared to the placebo; additionally, more participants in the lemon balm group were judged to have healed well by 5 days than in the placebo group.[PMID:23195812] The second, a 1999 trial in Bulgaria in 66 people with oral herpes who applied either lemon balm cream or a placebo 4 times a day for 5 days, found that the people who used the lemon balm had lower combined symptom scores on day 2 than people using the placebo, but the difference by day 5 was not [glossary:significant].[PMID:10589440] To summarize, based on the limited available research, lemon balm cream appears to be moderately effective for HSV sores and may ease the course of an outbreak. Not much research has directly compared lemon balm to prescription antiviral medications. Topical lemon balm may be better at reducing pain than topical acyclovir, but slower to promote healing, according to a 2015 study in 60 people in Iran with oral herpes. The study compared the effectiveness of applying a lemon balm gel to the affected areas for seven days to that of applying acyclovir 5% cream. Both groups of participants had similar reductions in lesion size after seven days, but the lemon balm group reported less pain, and the lesions in the acyclovir group shrank much more quickly.[reference|url=https://brieflands.com/articles/jjnpp-18429#A26160R2|title=Therapeutic Effect of Melissa Gel and 5% Acyclovir Cream in Recurrent Herpes labialis: A Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial|author=Ahadian H et al|journal=Jundishapur J Nat Pharm Prod|published=Nov 2015] However, it’s unclear from the study’s write-up when the treatments were applied — treatment is most effective before blisters appear, or at the latest within 48 hours of their appearance[PMID:28971780] — or how often they were applied. Furthermore, oral antiviral medications are more effective than topical ones[PMID:28971780] and are currently the standard of care for oral herpes.[PMID:29489260] Although more research is needed, the current picture favors prescription oral antivirals over lemon balm.**Lemon balm has not been clinically studied for any of the many other manifestations of HSV infection, and should not be used to treat them.

But more recent research hasn’t borne this out. A small 2020 RCT of lemon balm extract (providing 500 mg/day of RA) in 23 adults in Japan with mild dementia likely caused by AD found that, while lemon balm was safe and effective, there were no cognitive differences between the lemon balm and the placebo groups; the only [glossary:statistical-significance|significant] difference was a reduction in the “irritation/lability” subscale on one test, which is in line with what we know about lemon balm’s calming effect.[PMID:33122694] A follow-up RCT by the same researchers, of the same extract in the same dosage, in 323 adults without dementia but with subjective or mild cognitive impairment, failed to find any significant effect on cognition except in post-hoc subgroup analysis.[PMID:36502333]Lemon balm extract has also been studied for memory in young people without dementia, without conclusive results.

In addition to the names listed as “[also known as](https://examine.com/supplements/lemon-balm/#also-known-as)” on our lemon balm page, which are exclusively used for lemon balm, there are several common names that sometimes refer to lemon balm and sometimes to other plants. These include:- Balm mint - Mountain balm - Balm - Garden balm - Lemon mint - Badranjbuye - Baadranjboyaa - Billilotan - Honey balm- Faranjmoshk These common names often refer to lemon balm, but they’re also sometimes used to refer to other plants, mostly in the mint family. For example, “billilotan” can refer to lemon balm (*Melissa officinalis*), catnip (*Nepeta cataria*), or *Nepeta hindostana*.[reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-70638-2_995|title=""Melissa officinalis Linn.""

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3402/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/540/edit,MSM,What is MSM?,"MSM is an organosulfur compound that occurs naturally in some plants and animals. MSM is a product of the sulfur cycle — a cycle through which sulfur moves between the air, ground, and living things. Through this process MSM is eventually absorbed into the soil, where it can be taken up by plants and therefore is found in fruit, vegetables, and grains. MSM can also be manufactured by oxidizing another organosulfur compound, *dimethyl sulfoxide* (DMSO). There is no difference structurally between manufactured and naturally-occurring MSM, and the manufactured products are equally safe and make it much easier to reach the recommended dose.[PMID:28300758]",

Minor adverse events, such as gastrointestinal upset, skin rash, and allergies have been reported. In one animal study, these adverse effects were first noted at around 17 times the maximum recommended dosage. No changes to kidney or liver function have been noted with MSM use up to 6 grams per day.[PMID:19474240][PMID:12387309][PMID:31331587]In a study done on rats, MSM was found to be safe during pregnancy, but this is not yet confirmed in human studies,[PMID:17258373] and while the use of MSM during breast feeding is thought to be safe, there is little evidence to support this.[PMID:35349240]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3405/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/540/edit,MSM,How does MSM work?,"MSM works through several different mechanisms. MSM inhibits the proinflammatory *nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells* (NF-κB) pathway, leading to lower levels of inflammatory cytokines including *[interleukin 1|interleukin-1]* (IL-1) and  *[TNF-alpha|tumor necrosis factor-α]* (TNF-α). The inhibition of the NF-κB pathway may also inhibit *cyclooxygenase-2* (COX2), an enzyme that plays a role in inflammation.[PMID:28300758] The reduction in COX2 and the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines can also have [antioxidants|antioxidant] effects, as they regulate the generation of [reactive oxygen species]. MSM (and other sulfur-containing compounds) also regulates immune function, potentially inhibiting [interleukin 6|interleukin-6] and modulating cell death in certain types of cancer cells. MSM may also promote cartilage and bone health by stimulating signal molecules that promote osteogenesis (the formation/development of bone) and cartilage differentiation. These effects have been demonstrated in *[glossary:in vitro]* studies and in animal studies, and more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms through which MSM works in humans.[PMID:28300758][PMID:37447322]",

MSM may be useful in the treatment of certain types of [breast cancer], particularly *human epidermal growth factor receptor 2* (HER2) positive breast cancer. *[Glossary:In vitro]* studies have shown that MSM could slow cell growth and increase cell death in breast cancer cells. It might also improve the effectiveness of some chemotherapy agents used in breast cancer, such as tamoxifen and herceptin.[PMID:26648017][PMID:22485142][PMID:26084564]MSM may have similar effects on prostate cancer cells, because it has been found to induce cell death and slow down the cellular reproduction cycle, and it may reduce the ability of the cells to invade surrounding tissues.[PMID:30339981] These findings have been replicated for lung cancer[PMID:32234879] and liver cancer.[PMID:24575169] It is important to remember that these are preliminary studies done *in vitro*, and more research, including clinical trials, will need to be done to confirm the efficacy of MSM as a treatment for cancer.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3407/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/interventions/540/edit,MSM,Does MSM reduce exercise-induced pain?,"MSM is sometimes recommended to athletes or to people who have a lot of muscle or joint pain after exercise. Since it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, it is possible that MSM could mitigate the inflammatory response that occurs following intense exercise. Evidence to support this theory is limited, but some studies have found that MSM taken at 3 grams daily for up to 3 weeks before a major exercise bout and continuing for several days after the exercise could reduce muscle soreness and fatigue.[PMID:23013531][PMID:28736511] [oxidative stress biomarkers|Markers of oxidative stress] (such as oxidized [glutathionegsh|glutathione] and [glossary:malondialdehyde]) and markers of inflammation (such as [interleukin 1|interleukin-1], [interleukin 6|interleukin-6], and [tumor necrosis factor-alpha]) could be lower after exercise in people who take MSM daily.[PMID:21899544][PMID:27844051][PMID:28736511][PMID:22525613][PMID:23013531][reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.27.1_supplement.1076.7|title=A Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Evaluation of MSM for Exercise Induced Discomfort/Pain.|authors=Kalman D. et al|journal=FASEB J|published=2013-04-01][reference|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-12-S1-P48|title=MSM enhances LPS-induced inflammatory response after exercise|authors=Godwin, S. et al|journal= J Int Soc Sports Nutr|published=2015-09-21] The available evidence is not yet conclusive, and larger clinical trials are still needed to confirm these findings.

The fingers and toes are the most common areas affected, but Raynaud’s can also affect the nose and ears.During a Raynaud’s attack, loss of blood flow to the affected area causes the tissue to turn a pale white color. As blood in the area loses oxygen, the tissue becomes blue and feels cold and numb. When circulation is restored, the affected areas turn red and become swollen. People may also experience a tingling, burning, or throbbing sensation at this stage. Attacks can last from minutes to hours, but in rare cases Raynaud’s attacks can last for days, causing permanent damage to the affected areas.[reference|url:https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/raynauds-phenomenon|title=Raynaud’s phenomenon; USA: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, cited Oct. 2024, updated July 2024][PMID: 29763008]  Severe attacks, which are more common with secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon, can cause ulcers or sores to form on the end of the affected fingers or toes.",

https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3417/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/topics/1333/edit,Raynaud's Phenomenon,What causes Raynaud’s phenomenon?,"The most common cause of Raynaud’s phenomenon is overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. This causes an increased release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which binds to and activates adrenergic receptors. When the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on blood vessels are activated, the smooth muscle tissue that lines the blood vessel walls contracts, causing vasoconstriction (a narrowing of blood vessels). Excessive blood vessel constriction reduces blood flow to the extremities, which causes the characteristic changes in skin color associated with Raynaud’s as well as pain, tingling, and numbness.There are two main variants of Raynaud’s: primary and secondary. With primary Raynaud’s, the disorder occurs on its own, independent of any underlying condition. In contrast, secondary Raynaud’s is caused by the presence of another underlying condition, such as lupus, scleroderma, or other  autoimmune disorders.[PMID: 29763008]",

Because Raynaud’s mostly affects the hands, severe attacks can make it difficult to type or grasp objects.  - **Tissue damage:** It is also important to get medical treatment if sores or ulcers form after a Raynaud’s attack to avoid permanent scarring and damage. - **Secondary Raynaud’s diagnosis:** Getting treatment for the underlying conditions that trigger secondary Raynaud’s, such as an autoimmune disorder, is critical for managing symptoms and avoiding complications. Secondary Raynaud’s attacks can be more severe than primary Raynaud’s, increasing the likelihood of permanent tissue damage and scarring.

This triggers a type of ischemia-reperfusion injury, generating high levels of reactive oxygen species that are damaging to the tissue. In response to the damage, the immune system is mobilized, causing immune cells to move into the area and secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The characteristic deep-red and swollen appearance of the affected digits, as well as the pain and throbbing sensations, are caused by the inflammatory response.

However, it is important to note that the comparisons made in these meta-analyses were based on a small number of studies and there was considerable between-study [glossary:heterogeneity].[PMID:37818728][PMID:37500345][PMID:33220625] For this reason, it is not currently possible to conclude that one type of cinnamon is better than another; high-quality [glossary:randomized controlled trials] comparing cinnamon types — e.g., “Ceylon cinnamon” (*Cinnamomum zeylanicum/Cinnamomum verum*) vs. “Cassia cinnamon” (*Cinnamomum cassia*) — are needed to make such a conclusion.",
