https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/1/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,What is autoimmune disease?,"Our immune system keeps us healthy by fighting off invading pathogens while simultaneously sparing our own cells and tissues. In healthy people, the immune system is able to distinguish between the self and nonself, a concept called self-tolerance. When the body is functioning properly, the immune system maintains self-tolerance while working in the background to protect the body from infections. In people with autoimmune disease, self-tolerance does not function correctly, causing the body to turn the powerful weapons of the immune system against self molecules, causing [inflammation] and injury. Autoimmune disease can be systemic, affecting multiple parts of the body, such as in diseases like *[systemic lupus erythematosus]* (SLE). They can also be organ-specific, such as in [type 1 diabetes], where the immune system targets and destroys the [insulin]-producing cells of the pancreas.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/2/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,How could diet affect autoimmune disease?,"Preclinical studies show that dietary interventions, such as elimination diets and calorie restriction in various forms (e.g., chronic caloric restriction, time-restricted feeding (TRF), and [intermittent fasting](https://examine.com/diets/16-8-intermittent-fasting/), etc.) can potentially have beneficial effects on the immune system. However, more human trials are still needed to provide a better understanding of when, and in whom, these interventions are effective. It is also important to keep in mind that the efficacy and safety of diet interventions will likely vary from person to person, with some potentially being harmful for certain people.Metabolic status in the body is intimately connected to immune function. For example, undernourished people tend to be more susceptible to infections, while the nutrient excess associated with the Western diet may be associated with increased risk of autoimmunity.[PMID:24338487] This suggests that in the future, appropriate diet interventions could potentially help to reduce disease activity in people with active disease, or even lessen disease risk in those who are susceptible.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/3/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,Which supplements are of most interest for autoimmune disease?,"Many supplements, particularly those with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activity, have been investigated for their ability to reduce the severity or incidence of autoimmune disease. To date, some of the more promising evidence is for [vitamin D] and [fish oil], which were linked to reduced incidence of autoimmunity in a large randomized controlled trial.[PMID:35082139] Further research is needed to better understand the way that supplements may affect the incidence or severity of  autoimmunity in different people.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/4/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,What is a flare?,"Symptoms of many autoimmune diseases tend to increase during the active phases of the disease, and lessen or even go away during periods of remission. The term ‘flare’ refers to periods of active disease, during which symptoms can return or new symptoms develop. Flares sometimes seem to come out of nowhere, but are also often triggered by environmental factors such as injury, [stress], or infection. Anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat flares and bring about remission.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/5/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/15/edit,Autoimmune Disease,Is it true that even healthy people can have autoantibodies?,"Yes. Healthy people have autoreactive B cells and T cells that lead to the production of  natural autoantibodies (NAA) that bind to self-antigens, but with only low to moderate affinities. In contrast to the harmful type of autoantibodies that cause the immune system to target self-tissues, NAA are beneficial and play a role in regulating[PMID:27833954] the immune system.Although NAA were first discovered[PMID:14283590] back in 1963, their exact role in the body still isn’t clear. They are thought to play a role in the first line of defense to infections and may be protective[PMID:23186367] in people with autoimmune disease.[PMID:21123325]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/6/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/12/edit,Cancer,What is cancer?,"Cancer is a collection of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell replication and growth.[PMID:35022204] Solid cancers form a harmful tumor from a specific type of tissue, while hematological (blood) cancers form from lymphatic and blood tissues.[reference|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570326/|title=Mechanisms of carcinogenesis: from initiation and promotion to the hallmarks|published=2019|authors=Baan RA, Stewart BW, Straif K|journal=IARC Scientific Publications] As cancers grow, they become more malignant, and the most advanced cancers spread to other areas of the body in a process called metastasis. Some types of cancer can be treated with a high margin of success, while other cancers usually lead to death.[PMID:18362256]",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/7/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/12/edit,Cancer,How could diet affect cancer?,"Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary patterns are a large contributor to the global cancer burden and are a key area to focus on for preventing cancer.[PMID:31758189] A number of diet intervention studies confirm the role of diet in cancer risk by looking at markers of cancer risk,[PMID:21372038] but few interventions have actually tested the effect of diet on preventing cancer.[PMID:32031879][PMID:22524186] The majority of dietary interventions focus on either preventing cancer recurrence, slowing progression, or managing the symptoms of cancer and cancer treatments.[PMID:35057525][PMID:33003518][PMID:22048034] Generally speaking, weight management through diet and [antioxidant]-rich diets are focal points in nutrition for cancer research.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/8/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/12/edit,Cancer,Which supplements are the most studied for cancer?,"Some examples of well-studied *herbal supplements* in the context of cancer are [traditional Eastern herbal medicines](https://examine.com/other/traditional-chinese-medicine/), [garlic], [caffeine], [guarana], [spearmint] and [peppermint]. A decades-old body of research also points to the use of [cannabis] and [CBD] for managing symptoms of cancer treatment.Vitamins and nutrients that have been thoroughly studied include [vitamin D], [vitamin E], [vitamin C], [vitamin A|vitamin A and beta-carotene], [selenium], [zinc], and combinations of these vitamins.Supplements that may improve [gut health] symptoms caused by cancer treatment include [glutamine], [probiotics](https://examine.com/supplements/probiotic/), [ginger], [short-chain fatty acids], [proteolytic enzymes], [kefir], [honey], and [propolis], among many others.",
https://admin.examine.com/content/faqs/9/edit,https://admin.examine.com/content/categories/12/edit,Cancer,Why is cancer research important?,"Despite affecting 1 in 6 people and ranking high on causes of mortality globally, 33–50% of deaths from cancer are from outcomes caused by modifiable behaviors. Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer, which is a particularly important issue for prevention efforts.[PMID:33538338]",
